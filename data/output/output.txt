Like a sea captain's compass or a pilot's navi gation system, the Eastern astrological system 
contains some of the most profound personal gu idance tools ever discovered. With their roots 
planted deeply in Taoist and B uddhist traditions, the variety of intriguing practices that make up 
the Eastern astrological system ar e unparalleled. Two of the most insightful are the Ba Zi (four 
pillars of destiny) and the Zi  Wei Dou Shu. Akin to our own personal weather maps, these 
systems offer us the choice to sail around life's storms or fly directly through its tempests. In Chinese Astrology: Exploring the Eastern Zodiac, I examined the 12 earthly branches (animal 
signs) and their respective archetypal characteris tics. We also discovered the five essential 
elements, and the relevance of one 's birth year. These branches and stems are the stepping stones 
we will use to move about through the deeper in tricacies of Chinese as trology. Each month, each 
day, and each two-hour segment of the 24-hour day is assigned a combination of animal sign 
(earthly branch) and element (heavenly stem). T ogether, they complete what is called the four 
pillars of destiny, or the Ba Zi (eight words). This ancient system  uses the five elements, with 
special emphasis placed on the "daymaster," or element and sign that rules the day you were 
born. 
The Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is the grandfather of all Chinese astrological specialties. This life 
chart (plotted in the form  of a rectangular rice paddy) takes us  on a tour of our destiny using the 
12 palaces, or houses. Decade by life-decade, major and minor star energies move in and out of 
each life palace in the birth chart. These stars revolve around the placemen t of the all-important 
Zi Wei, or "emperor star." Together, they pa int a rich personality po rtrait and can help you 
understand your destiny and assess your life options. 
I hope you enjoy this new journey and find these ancient arts good for thinking upon. 
  
 
  
  
 
  
The four pillars are the corn erstones of Chinese astrology. Ea ch year, month, day, and 2-hour 
period of each day is assigned a combination of one  of the 12 animal signs (branches) and one of 
the 5 elements (stems). Ba Zi means "eight word s" or "eight characters ," and denotes the one 
element and one animal sign in each of the four  "pillars." Two characters (one of the five 
elements placed on top of one of the 12 animal signs) times four pillars or positions (one for your 
birth year, one for your birth month, one for your  birth day, and one for your birth hour) equal the eight words. These eight words (four elements and four animal signs) comprise what is called 
the four pillars of destiny, or  Ba Zi. Here's an example: 
 
Eight Characters, Four Pillars 
Ba Zi is a system of astrology invented by Li Xu Zhong in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The 
system was later revised and updated by Xu Zi Ping of the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). The 
most authoritative work is the San Ming T ong Hui by Wan Yu Wu of the Ming Dynasty (1368-
1644 AD). As with each of the many forms of Chin ese divination, the four pillars began with a 
hypothesis, which was then supplemented by and confirmed through observations and 
experimentation until a formula was found that re turned reliable and consistent results. The 
ancient Chinese developed the art of four pilla rs of destiny as a method for understanding and 
enhancing our life experiences.  
A Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) star map of the heavens. 
Each year, month, day, and hour has its own ener gy, or qi. The qi that surrounds you as you take 
your first breath is your destiny. These complex energy patterns, stacked on top of each other, 
are what form the four pillars.  Each character (element and an imal sign) placed in your birth 
chart carries with it a frequenc y, or unique energy pattern, and the combination of these frequencies forms a certain synergy,  or influence. "Synergy" is th e working together of separate 
entities (signs and elements, in this case), coope rating for an advantageous final outcome. This 
dynamic between the stems (elements) and the branches (animal signs) is what makes up the four 
pillars birth chart, and what forms the sum and substance of your astral signature, or horoscope. 
Here is an example of a four pillars chart fo r a person born on September 5, 1959, at 10:34 a.m.: 
 
Each element (upper stem) and animal sign (lower br anch) is strategically pl aced in one of eight 
locations to tell the story of your destiny. Using information gathered from the time and date of 
your birth, a Chinese astrologer is then able to draw up a blue print or map of your karma and 
life, and advise you accordingly. 
This earliest of Chinese divination systems uses the five element placements in an individual's 
birth chart, especially the elem ent of the birth day, or daymaster, to examine and compare each 
pillar to the others. Forecasting is accomplished by comparing your birth chart to any given time, 
date, or person. The individual pillars are examined for harmony and conflict, balance and 
imbalance. Through these basic interactions and dis tinct patterns, each person can view his or her 
potential and determine his/her best days, months, years, and companions. 
The five elements are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. These five types of qi (life force) 
also have their yin and yang attr ibutes. Each element is expresse d once in its negative, feminine 
yin form, and once in it's positive, masculine yang form. Yin is more subtle, and Yang is more active. Each element is produced and subsequently  destroyed by another element in a delicate yet 
perfectly balanced cycle: 
O The producing, enhancing cycle: Water 4 Wood 4 Fire 4 Earth - Metal O The controlling cycle: Water 4 Fire 4 Metal 4 Wood - Earth 
O The weakening cycle: Water 4 Metal 4 Earth 4 Fire - Wood 
The five elements in their yin and yang expressi ons create 10 types of element qi, or the "10 
heavenly stems." The 12 animal signs, altern ating between yin and yang, are called the "12 
earthly branches." Each energy interacts in a spec ific way with the others, just as we do with 
different people. O Yang Wood Jia is like a tall tree, sturdy and growing upward. 
O Yin Wood Yi is like a shrub, grass, or graceful plant. 
O Yang Fire Bing is like a fore st fire-hot, raging, and quick. 
O Yin Fire Ding is like a candle flam e, flickering and burning slowly. 
O Yang Earth Wu is the tallest mountai n, crusty soil, and parched desert. O Yin Earth Ji is akin to garden soil, loamy and rich in nutrients. 
O Yang Metal Geng is like a sh arp sword, piercing and strong. 
O Yin Metal Xin is like intricate jewelr y that clasps and creates structure. 
O Yang Water Ren is like the deep ocean with its tempests and waves. 
O Yin Water Gui is like a lake or pool, calm on the surface. We will discuss the various manifestations of each  element and its effect on a chart further in 
Chapter 4. 
Life qi also comes in combinations of the 12 ear thly branches or animal signs. The 12 animal 
branches are: Rat (Zi), Ox (Chou), Tiger (Yin), Rabbit (Mao), Dragon (Chen), Snake (Si,) Horse 
(Wu), Goat (Wei), Monkey (Shen), Roos ter (You), Dog (Xu), and Pig (Hai). 
Once the chart is cast, the four pillars are exam ined for several salient features. Some of the 
questions an astrologer will ask are as follows: Are the pillar elements and signs within your 
chart harmonious with one another? Is there a cert ain element in the pillar that is supported or 
destroyed by any of the other elements? Are any of  the five elements too "heavy" or too "light" 
in your chart? Is there an element that is ab sent? The CD-ROM includ ed with this book will 
calculate your four pillars for you and make answering these questions easy. 
The first and most important aspect of any chart is the balance of the el ements contained within 
each pillar. The Chinese use various "cures" for el emental imbalances. If an element is light or 
weakened in a birth chart, that element beco mes lucky when supplemented. If an element is 
heavy or overpowering the others  in a birth chart, that elem ent becomes unlucky and should be 
minimized. This is an important aspect of this art which, with practice, will become a revealing 
window into your destiny. The various remedies for each elemental imbalance will be addressed 
further in Chapter 8. 
As mentioned previously, th ere are four pillars in the Ba Zi ch art. Each pillar has an animal sign 
branch at the bottom and one of the five element stems (in either yin or yang expression) on the 
top. The first pillar is calculated  on the year of birth, so it is called the year pillar. The second 
pillar is calculated on the month of birth, so it is called the mont h pillar. The third pillar is 
calculated on the day of birth, so it is called the day pillar (or "day master"). The fourth pillar is 
calculated on the hour of birth, so it is called the hour pillar. (It is  important to adjust the time of 
birth to true local time-for example,  if daylight saving time was in effect, this must be taken into 
account.) The year pillar is calc ulated using the Chinese solar year calendar (rather than the 
Chinese lunar calendar, which begins anywhere fr om mid-January to mid-February on a different 
date each year), which is based on the return of the sun and the subsequent cycles of the sun's 
orbit. The Chinese solar year begins on February 4 or 5, so if you were born in January in 1959, you would do your year pillar calculations base d on 1958, an Earth Dog year. The four pillars 
can show family background; relationship with parents, grandparents, children; marriage and romances; and relationships with bo sses, peers, partners, and subordina tes. In each pillar, life qi 
combines, clashes, strengthens, weakens, assists, a nd controls in a complex tango of energies. 
The most important pillar is the day pillar, or  daymaster. The top element stem represents you-
your spirit and your qi. The bottom animal sign bran ch is your marriage/partnership branch. It 
will tell you the quality of your intimate relationshi ps. The month pillar, also called the parents 
pillar, reveals your early childhood and your rela tionship with your parents and children. The 
hour pillar, also called the child ren pillar, reveals your career,  your relationships with your 
children, and old age. The year pillar reve als your karma, your family background, your 
ancestors, your grandparents, a nd the society in which you live. It also reveals your level of 
career achievement. 
After evaluating the element harmonies and clashes in the pillars, the next important step is to 
look at the compatibility between the branches, or animal signs, in the chart. Are they 
compatible, in opposition, conflicted, or enhanced ? Do the animal signs form any particular 
pattern? In Chapter 6 we will delv e into these various patterns. 
Depending on the month (season) in which someone is born, the daymaster element will be rated 
as strong or weak. This has nothing to do with th e strength or weakness of character. In certain 
months (seasons), some elements will be strong and others weak. Elements that are weak become 
the lucky elements when supplemented. Usually what  is weak in a chart is most desirable and 
what is strong (overpowering) is  least desirable. In Chinese metaphysics, whether it is feng shui, 
traditional Chinese medicine, or the four pillars of  destiny, when we talk about seasons and five 
elements we are talking about universal energy, both tangible and intangible. When we talk 
about strength and weakness of da ymasters, therefore, we are not  talking about local climate. 
When it is said that someone is born in the summer season, it means they were born in a month when the universal elemental energy of Fire a nd Earth was strong. It has nothing to do with the 
actual locale of  the birth. 
The elements go through 12 stages of life, so it is important to know at what stage the various 
elements were during birth, because this has an impact on one's life. If your daymaster element is 
Wood, it is strongest if you were born in the sp ring, and weakest in the fall. If your daymaster 
element is Fire, it is strongest if you were born in the summer, and weakest in the winter. If your 
daymaster element is Earth, it is strongest if  you were born between seasons or during late 
summer, and weakest during the winter-spring tran sition. If your daymaster element is Metal, it 
is strongest if you were born in the fall, a nd weakest during the sp ring. If your daymaster 
element is Water, it is strongest if you were born in the winter, and w eakest during the summer. 
With the help of the four pillars chart, we can  examine and analyze our inherent strengths and 
weaknesses, and set our life sails to catc h the wind in just the right direction. 
Pages 18-19: The binomial 60-year cycle. Chinese years are classified according to 10 heavenly 
stems and 12 earthly branches. The succession of stems and branches produces a 60-year calendar, or sexagenary cycle.  Each year, each month, each day, and each 2-hour period of the 
day is assigned one stem and one branch, a paring that is called a ganzhi. This sexagenary cycle 
has been used in some form for almost five millennia.  
 
  
 
  
The first pillar of destiny is the year pillar. Each  year is composed of two Chinese characters that 
depict the cosmic qi that is distinct to the year in which you were born. Using the software 
included, find your year pillar (C hinese birth year St/Br) in th e center of your Zi Wei Dou Shu 
chart. Your year pillar is calculated using the Chinese solar calendar, rather than the familiar eastern 
lunar calendar which begins on a different date each year anywhere from mid-January to midFebruary. Li Chun (the first day of spring, whic h falls on the 4th or 5th of February) begins 
the new earthly branch of each year for the Ba Zi. The year pillar changes at precisely this 
moment. The day pillar ch anges at midnight, local standard time,  and is used for the hour pillar. 
The Rat (Tze) 
Feb 5, 1924 to Feb 4, 1925: Wood Rat on the rooftops 
Feb 5, 1936 to Feb 4, 1937: Fire Rat of the fields Feb 5, 1948 to Feb 4, 1949: Earth Rat of the granary Feb 5, 1960 to Feb 4, 1961: Metal Rat on the crossbeams 
 
Feb 5, 1972 to Feb 4, 1973: Water Rat on the hilltop Feb 5, 1984 to Feb 4, 1985: Wood Rat of the mulberry tree 
Feb 5, 1996 to Feb 4, 1997: Fire Rat of the grasslands 
Feb 5 to Feb 4, 2009: Earth Rat of the granary 
If your year pillar is ruled by Tze, the earthly branch of the Rat, you possess charisma, charm, 
intelligence, and the ability to express yourself  both verbally and through the written word. 
Sociable and romantic, with complex emotions, you form deep emotional ties. Always thrifty, 
you count your pennies and know how  to spot a bargain. Impatient with those of slower wit or 
action, you need an energetic (perhaps younger) part ner with a good sense of humor. Talkative, 
creative, and a natural critic, you are curious, re sourceful, and ever aler t to your environment. 
Your tendency toward concealment makes you a natural for undercover wo rk or any kind of profession that entails confidentiality or the need for secrecy. A strong survival instinct is 
inherent in this year pillar, as is  great longevity. It is said that those born in to this yearly branch 
will acquire the gift of prophecy in old age. 
Wood Rat The creative Wood element produces  a Rat who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and elegance. 
Wood Rats are inclined to  be carefree and blessed with a more  relaxed style than other Rats, but 
they are still susceptible to wo rry. If you are a Wood Rat, you must  allow your imagination a free 
rein via poetry, writing, and arti stic endeavors of all types. Keep a close eye on your passions, 
impulses, and aggressive outbursts, as Wood is  flammable and can stir anger and dangerous 
obsessions. The organ of Wood is the liver, so it is best to limit alcoholic beverages for optimum 
health. 
Fire Rat 
The impassioned Fire element makes for a lively,  intense Rat who is a natural leader and 
transformer. If you are this sign, changes, makeovers, and animated conversions are your 
specialty. Lucid, clairvoyant and emotional, Fire Rats reject medioc rity, conformity, and 
bookish, conventional ways of expressing them selves. High-minded and with great moral 
thinking and principles, Fire Rats  are nevertheless always susceptible to the Fire element's 
excesses. The organ of Fire is the heart and circ ulatory system, so keep an eye on blood pressure 
and arterial blockages. 
Earth Rat The practical Earth element yields a materialisti c, prudent Rat who is concerned with the here-
and-now. Shrewd, subtle, and contemplative, Earth Rats make knowledgeable businesspeople 
and entrepreneurs. If you are an Earth Rat, be careful of deliberating too long and thereby 
missing opportunities, as the Earth element ma kes you deeply contemplative and measured. 
Productive, cunning, and delightfu lly crafty, the Earth Rat mu st resist hiding away in 
subterranean passages of his or  her own making. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be 
moderate with sweets and watch a tendenc y toward diabetes and weight gain. 
Metal Rat 
The structured and defining Metal element brings  forth an outspoken Rat who can be austere, 
scrupulous, and verbally astute to the point of  hurling some profoundly stinging verbal barbs. 
These are merely truths to the Metal Rat, as they call `em like they see `em. Organizational 
geniuses and natural experts at  putting plans into action, Metal Rats vacillate between beauty, 
creativity, and purity on one hand, and sadness, severity, and destru ction on the other. The organ 
of Metal is the lungs, so be careful of breathing difficulties and take good care of your 
respiratory system. 
Water Rat The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gives birth to a calmer Rat who knows how to 
listen. Water soothes the aggressive impulses of  this earthly branch; this Rat knows how to 
control his or her passions. Skilled craftspeople, defenders of the peace, and determined 
humanists, Water Rats are human e and benevolent leaders who c ould easily rule the masses. 
Helpful, sympathetic, and tolera nt, you can easily be encroached upon and taken advantage of if 
you are a Water Rat. Don't give more than you recei ve. The organ of Water is the kidneys, so be 
sparing with salty foods and take good care of your urinary system. 
The Ox (Chou) 
 
Feb 4, 1925 to Feb 5, 1926: Wood Ox of gold in the sea 
Feb 4, 1937 to Feb 5, 1938: Fire Ox of the boiling stream (steam) Feb 4, 1949 to Feb 5, 1950: Earth Ox of the shelter/ roof 
Feb 4, 1961 to Feb 5, 1962: Metal Ox of the main road 
Feb 4, 1973 to Feb 5, 1974: Water Ox of the little stream Feb 4, 1985 to Feb 5, 1986: Wood Ox of gold in the sea 
Feb 4, 1997 to Feb 5, 1998: Fire Ox of the boiling stream (steam) 
Feb 4, 2009 to Feb 5, 2010: Earth Ox of the shelter/roof 
If your year pillar is ruled by Chou, the earthly branch of the Ox, you have been blessed with 
endurance, stamina, and the ability to efficiently  run a home, a corporati on, or even a country. 
Hardworking, serious, and opinionated, the Ox is a determined, str ong, and conservative 
personality. The gift bequeathed from your ancestors is manual dexterity, nimbleness, and a 
proclivity for working with your hands. Family, country, and duty are of utmost importance to 
those born into this year pillar. They are powerful individuals w ith traditional, reliable, and sometimes stubborn personalities. This quiet a nd strong pillar reveal s a homebody who possesses 
intense passion beneath a calm exterior. If you are an Ox, you will always need to be captain of 
your own ship. Your home will always be your castle-fill it with rosy-cheeked children, a healthy 
garden, and beloved pets. 
Wood Ox The creative Wood element produces  an Ox who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and elegance. 
Wood Oxen are blessed with a more relaxed style than other Oxen, but they are still susceptible 
to being too serious or grim. Poet s, musicians, and artists find themselves born into this astral 
pattern. You are full of ideas, yet you have your feet firmly on the ground. This is because you 
possess an affinity for the earth itself A dignified  attitude conceals your great sensitivity; others 
may be surprised at how tender your emotions ar e and how great your passion is. Strong of will, 
with an inborn sense of balance, you search for a quality life rather than allowing yourself to be 
driven by success as the world knows it. The organ of Wood is the liver, so be on guard against 
outbreaks of anger, social anxiety, and narrow-mindedness for optimum health. 
Fire Ox 
The Fire element emblazons this Ox's need for harmony and beauty. Fire Oxen are the dreamers 
and creatives of this world. Natural leaders wi th a mystical spark, Fire Oxen are drawn to 
politics, but always remain fier cely individualistic. Fond of combat and the spirit of the game, 
your tenacity will get the better of any resistance. Your extraord inary skills tend to move you at 
high speed. Take care not to run out of steam; slow down and don't overdo things. The sensual 
Fire Ox must be cautious, as Fire moves rapidly and can make you prone to excesses of all types, 
especially during middle age. Fire governs the h eart and circulatory system , so relax and respect 
your body's limits and natural rhythms. 
Earth Ox The abundant Earth element brings into bei ng a contemplative, hardworking Ox who is 
concerned with the here-and-now. Earth Oxen ar e blessed in any venture connected with the 
earth, soil, or food. Whether a winegrower, farmer , restaurant entreprene ur, or leader of a 
religious sect, the earth Ox is a hardworking, ba lanced, and patient individual. If this is your 
sign, be careful of being too leisurely or ponde ring too long and thereby missing opportunities. 
Thrifty, placid, and a lover of nature, the Earth Ox needs plenty of fresh air, freshly ploughed 
fields, serene ponds, and quiet sp ots unknown to others. The fertile earth is your preferred retreat 
and personal paradise. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be moderate with rich foods and 
watch a tendency to put on weight. 
Metal Ox 
The structured and defining Metal element bri ngs forth a serious and rigid Ox who can be 
austere, stern, and rigorously traditional. The el ement of Metal symbolizes clarity, purity, and 
precision, which makes Metal Oxen excellent admini strators, organizers, a nd leaders. If you are 
a Metal Ox, you need the concrete, the real, and the workable. Achieving your goals is of the highest importance, and you believe wholehearte dly that the needs of the many outweigh the 
needs of a few. You are full of energy, constant , and true to your wo rd; however, the Metal 
element can also cause you to be slightly cutti ng or take yourself too seriously-so relax? The 
organ of Metal is the lungs, so take good car e of your respiratory sy stem and refrain from 
smoking. 
Water Ox The sheltering, deep, and intuitive Water element gi ves birth to a sensitive and spiritually minded 
Ox who wears his/her heart on his/her sleeve. Wa ter soothes the somber, serious side of this 
earthly branch, and enab les this Ox to nurture and look af ter others. Defenders of peace and 
caretakers of the most vulnerable amongst us, Wa ter Oxen make doting and attentive parents. 
Family life will make you happiest, and a cozy ho me filed with well-behaved children will be 
heaven on earth for you. Water Oxen have a fear of making scenes, which can make them appear 
timid or fearful; however, nothing could be further from the truth! When you decide to move out 
into the world, you could create a business, chair a political cause, or even found a new religion. 
The organ of Water is the kidneys, so be cauti ous regarding blockages,  circulatory problems, 
edema, and emotional obstructions. 
The Tiger (Yin) 
 
1926 Feb 13 to Feb 1, 1927: Fire Tiger of the furnace 
1938 Jan 31 to Feb 18, 1939: Earth Tiger climbing mountains 1950 Feb 17 to Feb 5, 1951: Metal Tiger of mountain pines 
1962 Feb 5 to Jan 24, 1963: Water Tiger of the streams 1974 Jan 23 to Feb 10, 1975: Wood Tiger of the forest 1986 Feb 9 to Jan 28, 1987: Fire Tiger of the furnace 
1998 Jan 28 to Feb 15, 1999: Earth Tiger climbing mountains 
2010 Feb 14 to Feb 2, 2011: Metal Tiger of mountain pines 
If your year pillar is ruled by Yin, the earthly branch of the Tiger, you are a restless, adventurous, 
risk-taker at heart. With your sense of em powerment and entitlement, noble and humanitarian 
causes appeal to you. Blessed with a tenderhearted and affectionate core, you are also self-reliant and fiercely independent. Graced with charm, br avery, and grand ideas, Tigers flash brilliantly 
through this life, sometimes w ithout caution for their own safety and security. Courageous, 
enthusiastic, and optimistic, the passionate Tiger is an unconventional yet humanitarian soul who 
resists day-to-day routines in favor of a new adventure. Possessing a deep, almost old-fashioned 
sense of self-sacrifice, Tigers specialize in protecting those weak er than themselves. They make 
first-rate friends as well as  the frankest of enemies. 
Wood Tiger 
The creative Wood element produces a Tiger who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and elegance. 
The Wood element brings gentleness to the Tiger, softening pride and giving full rein to a fertile 
imagination. Those born with the Wood Tiger as thei r year pillar seem at ease; however, this is 
an illusion and a mask, behind which they ski llfully hide their anxi ous nature. Wood is a 
balancing element for Tigers, yet Wood is also  flammable and the element of passion-even 
destruction. The Wood Tiger can therefore be co nfusing to others. If you are a Wood Tiger, 
beneath a peaceful exterior your spirit is stirre d by excessive and explosive impulses. The organ 
of Wood is the liver, so it is best if Wood Tige rs limit alcoholic beverages for optimum health. 
Passionate and engaging, Wood Ti gers are lovers of liberty and personal freedom. The stage 
attracts you, the limelight awaits you, and the crowd's eyes are fixed upon you? 
Fire Tiger The impassioned Fire element makes for a Tiger who is , quite literally, born to be in charge. Fire 
is Yang, the positive, masculine day force which animates, transforms, and quickens. For Tigers, 
Fire is the flame of energy and dynamism, a creativ e and stimulating force. Ideas flash and fly as 
fast as lightning, and hunches will  be right on target. This is a lucid and clairvoyant Tiger. 
However, Fire is often a symbol of war, passion, and vi olence. For the impetuous and ardent Fire 
Tiger, moderation is called for with this combination of element and sign. The Fire Tiger is high-minded, principled, and highly moral, yet will al ways be susceptible to the Fire element's 
excesses. If this is your sign, you are a loyal, royal, and highly virtuous in dividual. Fire governs 
the heart and circulatory syst em, so guard against stress. 
Earth Tiger 
The practical Earth element brings into being a worldly, wise, and sensible  Tiger who has his or 
her feet planted firmly on the ground. Earth Ti gers are concerned with the here-and-now and 
they obtain goals as a result of re peated and diligent efforts. Shrewd, assertive, and mature, Earth Tigers are knowledgeable busine sspeople and entrepreneurs. If you are an Earth Tiger, you likely 
dream of a fortress with the secu rity of impregnable castle walls ; however, take a chance, go out 
of your comfort zone a bit, and expand your horizons. The Earth element makes you deeply 
thoughtful and measured, so be  careful of deliberating t oo long and thereby missing 
opportunities. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so  be moderate with sweets and watch a tendency 
toward weight gain. Also, beware of becoming mired, stuck, or trapped by the influence of the 
Earth element. 
Metal Tiger The structured and defining metal element brings  forth a prepared Tiger who can be austere, 
scrupulous, and verbally astute to the point  of handing down some shockingly candid 
assessments. These verbal barbs are merely obser vational truths to the Metal Tiger. Natural 
leaders and chiefs, Metal Tigers are experts when implementing plans of action and converting 
concepts and ideas into reality. "Do it my way and it will be fun" could be their motto. If you are 
a Metal Tiger, flexibility could benefit you, as could more tenderness, subtlety, and diplomacy. 
A lack of tact can seriously jeopardize delicate i ssues of negotiation; it is  important to keep in 
mind that it easier to wound than to heal. The organ of Metal is  the lungs, so get enough fresh 
air, be careful of breathing difficulties, a nd take good care of your respiratory system. 
Water Tiger 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gives birth to a calmer and more spiritually 
perceptive Tiger. Water soothes the savage b east, so to speak, and dampens the inherent 
aggressive impulses of this earthly branch. Natura l warriors of righteous causes and heroes in 
difficult dilemmas, Water Tigers can be found in foreign countrie s as missionaries and teachers, 
and are known to be great humanitarians of the highest order. Defenders of the peace and 
determined leaders, Water Tigers are humane and benevolent benefactors.  If this is your sign, 
burnout and exhaustion can be your ne mesis, so it is important to take time for rest and personal 
rejuvenation. Don't give more than you receive, keep a healthy life balance, and, above all, avoid 
parasitic people who drain your vigor. The organ of Water is the kidneys, so go light on salty 
foods and take good care of your kidneys and urinary system. 
The Rabbit (Mao) Feb 5, 1927 to Feb 4, 1928: Fire Rabbit dreaming of the moon 
Feb 5, 1939 to Feb 4, 1940: Earth Rabbit of mountain pines 
Feb 5, 1951 to Feb 4, 1952: Metal Rabbit of the burrow Feb 5, 1963 to Feb 4, 1964: Water Rabbit of the forest pond 
Feb 5, 1975 to Feb 4, 1976: Wood Rabbit of enlightenment 
Feb 5, 1987 to Feb 4, 1988: Fire Rabbit dreaming of the moon Feb 5, 1999 to Feb 4, 2000: Earth Rabbit of mountain pines 
Feb 5, 2011 to Feb 4, 2012: Metal Rabbit of the burrow 
 
If your year pillar is ruled by Mao, the earthly branch of the Ra bbit, you have been blessed with 
good manners, diplomacy, and, above all, virtue. One part of your being is easygoing, refined, 
and social; the other is detached and aloof, and will flee personal upheaval and disruption 
whenever possible. Those born with this year pillar are naturally talented  and have been blessed 
with excellent taste. Most can excel in the fine arts, are highly creative, and are sensitive to 
beauty in all of its forms. Well-grounded a nd upright, you shun personal drama and emotional 
entanglements, choosing instead security and a pe aceful existence. Rabbits are amazing business 
partners and supportive friends. Se nsitive and easily hurt, these private souls keep their own 
council but are highly s ought after for their advice. Nonviolen t and relaxed strategists by nature, 
Rabbits possess a quiet sensuality and an aptitude for self-preservation. 
Wood Rabbit 
The creative Wood element produces  a Rabbit who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and elegance. 
Wood Rabbits are the muses of the Rabbit family. Ar t, music, and literature are the gifts from 
your ancestors. The Wood element brings out a sens e of adventure in the Rabbit, as well as a 
passion for travel and a love of nature. Sociall y, you are perceived as being calm and relaxed; 
however, the Wood element leaves you vulnerable to  anxiety and excessive worry. The organ of 
Wood is the liver, so it is best to limit alcohol ic beverages. Do not let yourself be drowned by 
your emotions for optimum health. 
Fire Rabbit 
The impassioned Fire element makes for a lively, in tense Rabbit blessed with  great fervor who is 
a natural leader and transformer. Lucid, clair voyant, and emotional, Fire Rabbits reject 
mediocrity and conventional ways of expres sing themselves. Virtuous, and with high-minded 
thinking and ethics, the naturally prudent and re served Rabbit can also be bold and sometimes even rash. These two sides will continually fight for dominance, a process which can actually 
increase and strengthen this Rabbit's cour age. If this is your sign, you will embrace your 
boldness, but always remember to remain faithfu l to your deepest nature. Reason should always 
be in control of your excesses. The organ of Fire is the heart and circulatory system, so keep an 
eye on your heart and watch a te ndency toward aggressiveness. 
Earth Rabbit 
The no-nonsense Earth element brings into being a worldly yet sensible Rabbit who is concerned 
with practical pursuits. Shrew d, subtle, and thoughtful, Earth Rabbits are knowledgeable 
businesspeople and entrepreneurs. Your natural caution and insistence that time is always on 
your side may cause you to deliberate too long and miss opportunities. This  is a stay-at-home, 
cozy Rabbit who prefers warm refuges over the challenges of the outside world. The Earth 
element is all about slow and profound transforma tions, and so is the Earth Rabbit. The Earth 
Rabbit must resist hiding away in a cushioned wa rren and risk the trials and tribulations of life 
outside. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be  moderate with sweets, get some exercise, and 
avoid weight gain. 
Metal Rabbit 
The structured and defining metal element brings forth a self-confident Rabbit who can be 
circumspect, severe, and even bl unt. Metal Rabbits vacillate betw een beauty, creativity, purity on 
the one hand; and sadness, severity, and destructi on on the other. The Metal element tends to be 
cutting, rigid, and even harsh at times. Remember not confuse strength of purpose with stiffness. 
The Metal Rabbit seeks solitude and is attracted to mystical pursuits, but may have difficulty harmonizing body and spirit. A stiff neck and a cold  heart are not in your nature; forgiveness is 
always in your best interest no matter how grievous the perceive d insult. The organ ruled by the 
element of Metal is the lungs, so be careful of breathing diffi culties and take good care of your 
respiratory system. 
Water Rabbit 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gi ves birth to a Rabbit who knows how to listen. If 
you are a Water Rabbit, you are calm and reflectiv e, and generally refrain from excesses. A 
certain timidity holds you back at  times-you may fear difficulties a nd be hesitant to rock the boat 
or complain. However, you are very much a p acifist and humanist, so you may find yourself 
embroiled in social problems and fighting against injustice, rather than pursuing introspective 
spiritual matters. A lack of self-confidence is your main w eakness, so don't stay in the 
background-be less passive and take the plunge? You don't need to recoil from your passions, 
but merely control them. Helpful, sympathetic, and tolerant, you can be encroached upon if you 
are perceived as too passive, so don't give more  than you receive. The organ of Water is the 
kidneys, so look after your spine and urinary tract.

2000 Feb 5 to Jan 23, 2001: Metal Dragon of patience 
2012 Jan 23 to Feb 9, 2013: Water Dragon of the rain 
 
If your year pillar is ruled by Chen, the earthly branch of the Dragon, you have been blessed with 
vital physical health, farsightedne ss, and the ability to envision the future. Outspoken, impatient, 
and self-assured, it is said that the lucky Dragon will have boundless energy and strength. You 
are the proudest of the 12 br anches and do not like to be ch allenged. Your unpredictability 
assures that others are either your friends or your rivals. Fortuna te, original, a nd enthusiastic, 
infatuate Dragons need a strong and intriguing partner, or else they  may stray to greener pastures 
or live a solitary life. Egotistica l and assertive attention-getters,  those with the Dragon as their 
year pillar are boisterous, flamboyant, and s howy. Successful and popular, this lucid sign 
produces individuals who are born to be in the p ublic eye. If you are a Dragon, the stage attracts 
you, the limelight awaits you, and th e crowd's eyes are fixed upon you! 
Wood Dragon 
The creative Wood element produces a Dragon w ho loves harmony, beauty, and elegance. The 
Wood element brings gentleness to the Dragon, soft ening pride and giving full rein to a fertile 
imagination. Those born with the Wood Dragon in th eir year pillar will always seem to be at 
ease; however, this is an illusion and a mask, behi nd which they skillfully hide an anxious and 
sometimes tormented personality. Beneath a peacef ul exterior, your spirit is stirred by excessive and explosive impulses from the Wood element. Wood is the symbol for excessive passion or 
anger; the Wood Dragon should be careful of this tendency. The physical organ of Wood is the 
liver, so stand against anxiety a nd don't self-medicate with alc ohol or excessive amounts of food 
for optimum health. 
Fire Dragon The impassioned Fire element makes for a Dragon w ho is born to be in the public eye in some 
way. Fire is yang, the positive, masculine day force that animates, burns, and transforms. Fire 
within the Dragon will strengthen your energy, making ideas flash and fly through your mind as 
fast as lightning. This is a lucid and clairvoyant Dragon; however, Fire is also a symbol of war, 
passion, and violence. Impetuous an d ardent, the Fire Dragon will be in a permanent state of 
alertness, with a thirst for lif e and an inexhaustible wellspring of activity and imagination. Fire 
governs the heart and circulatory system, so contro l anger and aggressiveness before they get out 
of hand. Reserve your strength and do  not burn your energy recklessly. 
Earth Dragon 
With its caverns and buried treasures, the practical Earth element is very beneficial for the 
Dragon. The Earth Dragon is more realistic than the other Dragons, and also more materialistic, cautious, and suspicious. Earth Dragons obtain goal s as a result of their repeated and diligent 
efforts. If you are an Earth Dragon, you are a ha rd and conscientious worker, and you enjoy 
speculation and accumulating wealth. Although you dr eam of a refuge with the security of 
impregnable castle walls, there is a time for rest and a time for acti on and discoveries. Expand 
your horizons? Be careful of deliberating too long and thereby missing opportunities, as the 
Earth element makes you deeply prudent and guarde d. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be 
moderate with sweets and watch a tendency towa rd weight gain. Also, beware of becoming 
mired, stuck, or trapped in life. Quiver your scal es and make the ground tremble, but do not close 
yourself up. 
Metal Dragon 
The structured and defining metal element brings forth a Dragon who is a gleaming sword. 
Outspoken, blunt, and future-orien ted, Metal Dragons implement plans of action and convert 
visionary concepts into realit y. If you are a Metal Dragon, you are an energetic and decisive 
person. You are also a natural-born  leader-fair, just, and honest. However, your lack of tact can 
critically jeopardize fragile negotiations. A litt le more flexibility could benefit you, as could 
more tenderness, subtlety, and diplomacy. You can  also be rather fanatical about work being 
done correctly and punctually, so relax, be more flex ible, and take time to play a bit. The organ 
of Metal is the lungs, so be di ligent to get enough fresh air, be vigilant concerning breathing 
difficulties, and take good care of your respiratory system. 
Water Dragon 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element sh ould theoretically give birth to a calmer and 
more reflective person, but this is rarely th e case with Water Dragons. They will be found involved in social problems as hu manists and as advocates of ju stice. The Water element turns 
you toward the hearts of your fellow humans . Water Dragons are humane and benevolent 
benefactors given to charitable ac ts (the more public and well-conne cted, the better). This priest 
or priestess of the Dragons is naturally drawn to metaphysics as a visionary, a prophet, or a self-
styled practitioner. The organ of Water is the kidneys, so be sparing with salty foods and take 
good care of your urinary system.

If your year pillar is ruled by Si, the earthly branch of the Sn ake, you are the wise philosopher 
and stealthy sage. Physically attr active, with flawless skin and flawless advice, the Snakes are 
the intellectuals, scholars, psychiatrists, and spiritual advisors of the world. Gradual, 
accumulated growth is your life pattern. Those born  with the deep-thinking Snake as their year 
pillar lean toward aesthetic interests such as musi c, art, and interior desi gn. Unusually gifted with 
deep intuition, Snakes are also  uncommonly sexually attractive. Insight, compassion, subtlety, 
and discretion are their sum and substance. This highly sensual branch is possessive and needs an emotional partner who abandons himor herself to passionate desire. The harmonious relationship 
between your well-kept, polished exterior and your reflective, lucid personality makes you 
irresistible? 
Wood Snake The creative Wood element produces a Snake who is a lover of the finer things in life. Wood 
Snakes love art, music, literature, and fine cr aftsmanship of any type. Inventive and creative, you 
have a gift for combining beauty and space. Th e Wood Snake has the soul of a connoisseur and 
artistic authority, and most are the personification of harm ony, charm, and beauty. With 
intentional improvisation, Wood Snak es will disentangle themselves from even the most difficult 
situations with finesse and charisma. The organ of the body that corresponds to Wood is the 
liver, so it's best to limit alcoholic beverages and not let yourself be consumed by your powerful 
emotions. Wood Snakes sometimes suffer from psychosomatic illnesses.

The fervent Fire element makes for a lively, intens e Snake. Blessed with great feeling, this Snake 
is a natural power-behind-the-throne and influential personality. Lu cid, level-headed, and

endowed with a power of rapid intellectual assi milation, Fire Snakes wish to constantly be 
learning something new. They make excellent teachers and philosophers. Fire Snakes enjoy 
giving advice and people naturally confide in th em; they make excellent personal and financial 
advisors. The organ of Fire is the heart and circ ulatory system, so keep an eye on your heart and 
your blood pressure, and watch a te ndency toward aggressiveness.

practicality. The protective and s oothing Earth Snake has a slow a nd enticing personal style. This 
is a stay-at-home, cozy Snake who prefers warm refuges over the challeng es and aggressions of 
the outside world. The Earth element is concer ned with slow and profound transformations, and 
so is the Earth Snake. The downside of this is that it can incite idleness, passivity, and 
procrastination at times.  If this is your sign, you must resist hiding away in a cushioned nest and 
risk moving out into the unsympathetic outside wo rld. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be 
moderate with sweets and watch a tendency to ward becoming sedentary and weight gain. 
Meta[ Snake 
The structured and defining metal element brings  forth a self-confident Snake who can be a bit 
severe. This Snake has no tolerance for fools. This is a no-nonsense individual who will vacillate 
between beauty, creativity, and purity on one hand;  and sadness, severity, and destruction on the 
other. The Metal element tends to be cutting, rigid, and even harsh at times. The Metal Snake seeks solitude and is attracted to mystical pursuit s. Despotic when angere d or agitated, too much 
rigidity can engender sadness or remorse. If th is is your sign, humor is your best friend and 
defense against drama and calamity. Surround yourse lf with positive, upbeat people; relax and stop chasing after inaccessible or "perfect" ideals. The organ ruled by the element of Metal is the 
lungs, so breathe deeply, seek the open air,  and take good care of your respiratory system. 
Water Snake 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gives birth to a Snake who is sensitive to the point 
of being psychic. Calm, reflective, and generally able to refrain from excesses, the Water Snake 
is a consummate sage, philosopher, and literary connoisseur. Those with the Water Snake in their 
year pillar will be led by their pacifist and humanis tic leanings as they listen to the problems of 
their fellow man. This is a cool-headed lead er as well as a warm , good-hearted character. 
Helpful, sympathetic, and tolerant, you could be taken advantage of if you are perceived as too 
passive, so don't give more than you receive. Y our wisdom and moderation are based on deep 
inner reflection. The organ of Water is the kidne ys, so look after your sp ine and urinary system.

quick-witted sportsperson and competitor. Charming, independent, and decisive, the Horse 
prefers to be always on the move, with places to  go and people to see. If you are a Horse, you are 
of the yang/masculine/day-force disposition, a natural leader who is both idealistic and 
humanitarian. You are also a gifted speaker  and strong communicator . Elegant, witty, and 
talkative, you are difficult to defeat in a dis pute and can always argue a persuasive case. You 
could be very successful in poli tics, public speaking, or sales. Those with an independent Horse

friendly, you will always need freedom to change your course at whim and maneuver 
unencumbered through life's pastures.

banalities of life. You are a lover of harmony and beauty, an d prefer anything creative and 
imaginative to reason and disciplin e. A natural sportsperson, the W ood Horse hates to lose and is 
extremely competitive. However, the Wood element brings a certain gentleness to this Horse, 
softening pride and giving full rein to a fertil e imagination. Those born with the Wood Horse as 
their year pillar will give the outward appearance of being at ease; however, inner anxieties and a 
secret fear of failure can cause difficulties such as depression and obsessions. Active and 
engaging, Wood Horses need absolute liberty an d personal freedom. The limelight calls to you,

The impassioned Fire element makes for a lucid and clairvoyant Horse who is destined for either 
fame or infamy. Fire is yang, the positive, masc uline day-force that animates, transforms, and

can be susceptible to the Fire element's excesses,  as well. Artistically and aesthetically gifted,

small doses to avoid burnout.

realistic than other Horses. Earth Horses are rea lists and materialists who advance prudently and 
skeptically through life. Lucky when it comes to fi nancial speculation, you have the potential to 
amass a considerable fortune. Full of ardor and initiative when young, middle age can bring 
preoccupation with comfort and se curity. Later years are spent de voting yourself to the needs of 
your family and investments. The Earth Horse is first and foremost an elegant and seductive conqueror-always preserve those youthful and dy namic qualities? The organ of Earth is the

social gatherings, stimulating conversation, a nd a beautiful environment. Polite, decent, and 
gentle, Goats desire a peaceful spot to exist und isturbed and unhurried. Creative, sensitive, and 
kind, those souls with Goat year pillars are also dependent, disorganized, and extremely 
vulnerable. They are capricious, work when leas t expected to, and are never reached by being 
pressured with a heavy hand. Sometimes insecu re and generous to a fault, you are a good 
Samaritan who has a soft heart toward thos e less fortunate. Whether a homeless puppy or a 
needy friend, you will always try to  help out if at all possible.

Goat, you are usually perceived as being calm and relaxed; however, the flammable Wood 
element can also leave you vulnerable to intern al jolts, anxieties, a nd excessive worry. The 
sensitive Wood Goat is sometimes re ferred to as "the mother of na ture," as the natural world and 
environment holds a strong attraction for this element and branch combination. The organ of 
Wood is the liver, so it is best to limit alcoholic beverages and keep your emotions in perspective 
for optimum health.

of persuasion. Lucid, clairvoyant and emotional, Fire Goats are natural survivors and 
manipulators of circumstances. They also tend to have strong personalities  and high expectations of others. The Fire element puts an exclamation mark  after this Goat's personality. If this is your 
sign, it will take all of your willpower  to restrain the latent aggre ssiveness of the Fire element. 
The Fire element is also a catalyst for expressive ness, so be careful not to dissipate your energy 
and exhaust your talents by entert aining your associates. The orga n of Fire is the heart and 
circulatory system, so keep an eye on these sy stems and watch for bloc kages of various kinds. 
Earth Goat 
The no-nonsense Earth element brings into be ing a worldly, more realistic Goat who is 
concerned with the here-and-now. Earth Goats are talented artisans, artis tic entrepreneurs, and 
charming personalities in general. This is a st ay-at-home, cozy Goat who prefers warm refuges 
over the aggressions of the outside world. If you are an Earth Goat, th e Earth element endows 
you with a natural caution and reticence; however, your impulsive sense of humor and carefree, 
whimsical nature will always gain the upper ha nd. You may be financia lly fortunate, as many 
Earth Goats are left with an i nheritance, trust fund, or other fi nancial windfall. The organ of 
Earth is the spleen, so be moderate with  sweets and watch a tendency toward becoming 
sedentary or putting on weight.

one hand; and sadness, severity, and destruction on the other. They are attracted to mystical 
pursuits, but may have difficulty harmonizing bo dy and spirit. If you are a Metal Goat, you are a 
curious mixture of fantasy and exactitude, tole rance and stubbornness. Th e Metal element tends 
to be cutting, rigid, and even harsh at times, which can conflict with your gentle yin nature. 
Remember not confuse strength of purpose with stiffness. The organ ruled by the element of 
Metal is the lungs, so be caref ul of breathing difficulties and blockages, and take good care of 
your respiratory system. 
Water Goat 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gi ves birth to a highly emotional, yet calm and 
reflective Goat. Water Goats are temperate and re flective, with a capacity  to listen to others; 
however, they also avoid difficulties and can be the first ones to despair or complain about a 
problem. If this is your sign, a cer tain timidity can hold you back at  times. Don't recoil from your 
passions-merely control them. When you're not pursuing introspective sp iritual matters, you may 
find yourself embroiled in a protes t or fighting against injustice as  a pacifist and a humanist. The 
organ of Water is the kidneys, so look after your and urinary tract system, remain active, and 
drink plenty of water to hydr ate your body. The Water element is a symbol of fertility and a

The Monkey (Shen)  
Feb 5, 1932 to Feb 4, 1933: Water Monkey of elegance

Feb 5, 2016 to Feb 4, 2017: Fire Monkey of independence 
If your year pillar is ruled by Shen, the earth ly branch of the Monkey, you are an eternally 
youthful, highly diverse, and clev er individual. Monkeys are qui ck, restless, enterprising, and 
irrepressible. Mischievous and high-spirited, those with this year pillar are social, active, 
convincing, and blessed with an entertaining sense of humor.  Imagination, ingenuity, and 
resourcefulness characterize those born with th eir year pillar in a year of the multifaceted 
Monkey. Versatile, curious, and easily bored, mischievous Monkeys are witty companions-
indulgent, intelligent, and ready to  play. Those with this earthly br anch are difficult to define due 
to their complex and sometimes contradictory na tures. If you are a Monkey, at times you may 
secretly suffer from feelings of exclusion, whic h can make you pessimist ic, skeptical, and even 
bitter. In reality, you only wish  to be admired, loved with i ndulgence, and understood. You must 
have movement, discussion, and an open exchange of ideas. 
Wood Monkey The creative Wood element produces a Monkey who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and 
elegance. Wood Monkeys are inclined to be carefree and blessed with a more relaxed style than 
other Monkeys. Understanding and tolerant, they ar e humanists of the first order. Temperate in 
nature and sensitive to nuances and tradition, you  appreciate the art of living. When angered or 
impassioned, quietness in nature and solitude will appease your frustrations and obsessions. Wood is flammable and can stir anger and danger ous fascinations, so keep a close eye on your 
passions, impulses, and aggressive ou tbursts. The organ of Wood is th e liver, so it is best to limit 
alcoholic beverages for optimum health. You may al so battle depression and have to exercise 
control over your deepest impulses to overcome dark moods and stop worrying about details. 
Fire Monkey 
The aggressive Fire element makes for an impassioned, intense Monkey blessed with great 
fervor who is a natural leader and agent of change. Lucid, clairvoyant, and emotional, Fire 
Monkeys reject mediocrity, conformity, and conv entional ways of expressing themselves. If you 
are a Fire Monkey, changes, makeovers, and conv ersions are your specialt y. You are a person of 
action and leadership, which is always couched in terms of vehement anti-conformism. Fire 
Monkeys seesaw between the satis faction of strong material need s and mystical aspirations, so 
your fervor and inner demands ma y press you toward the monkish solitude of a philosopher. Be 
careful to avoid fanaticism or  a tendency to isolate yourself  from your fellow man. The Fire 
element is subject to excesses, a nd the organ of Fire is the heart and circulatory system. Keep an 
eye on your heart, circulator y system, and blood pressure. 
Earth Monkey The levelheaded Earth element brings into bei ng a reasonable, shrewd Monkey who is concerned 
with practical pursuits. Shrew d, subtle, and materialistic, Ea rth Monkeys are knowledgeable 
businesspeople, convincing salespeople, and su ccessful entrepreneurs. Productive, cunning, and 
delightfully crafty, the Earth Monkey likes activi ties that bear fruit a nd will be attracted to 
speculation, banking, and real esta te-anything of tangible value, really. If you are an Earth 
Monkey, many of your enterprises will be motivated by an overriding need for expansion and an 
ever-increasing desire for worldly possessions. You can often feel distrustful and suspicious of 
those near you, which can make you difficult to li ve with. This usually stems from your worries 
about your financial security and future. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so be moderate with 
sweets and watch a tendency towa rd overeating and weight gain. 
Meta[ Monkey 
The structured and defining Metal element br ings forth an uncompromising, outspoken Monkey. 
The Metal Monkey can be austere, narrow-minded, scrupulous, and verbally astute to the point 
of hurling some profoundly stinging verbal barbs. However, these are merely truths to the Metal 
Monkey. Organizational geniuses and natural experts at putting plan s into action, Metal 
Monkeys will aim for high positions and great re sponsibilities, but will need diversity and 
innovation in their work. Metal Monkeys always stand apart and have a desire to be different. If this is your sign, you cannot tolerate the tedious routine of the daily grind. You also dislike 
having to explain or justify yourself, which come s from a taste for solitude as well as your communication problems. The organ of Metal is th e lungs, so be careful of breathing difficulties 
and take good care of yo ur respiratory system. 
Water Monkey 
The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gi ves birth to a clever and secretive Monkey who 
is an observant student of human nature. This trait can be used for better (encouragement and 
counseling) or worse (conning and tricking). The Water Monkey  looks at life uncertainly, 
through foggy lenses and with slightly confus ed vision. Water Monkeys need action, change, 
movement, novelty, and new discoveries. If you ar e a Water Monkey, the boredom of routine is 
your greatest enemy; mental stagnation can sour your good humor and staunch your creativity. 
Respect your need to question everything because it is one of the keys to your success. The organ 
of Water is the kidneys, so be  sparing with salty foods a nd take good care of your urinary 
system. 
The Rooster (You) 
 
Feb 4, 1933 to Feb 3, 1934: Water Rooster of the barnyard pond Feb 4, 1945 to Feb 3, 1946: Wood Rooster crowing at dawn 
Feb 4, 1957 to Feb 3, 1958: Fire Rooster of seclusion Feb 4, 1969 to Feb 3, 1970: Earth Rooster of foraging fields 
Feb 4, 1981 to Feb 3, 1982: Metal Rooster of steel cages 
Feb 4, 1993 to Feb 3, 1994: Water Rooster of the barnyard pond Feb 4, 2005 to Feb 3, 2006: Wood Rooster crowing at dawn 
Feb 4, 2017 to Feb 3, 2018: Fire Rooster of seclusion If your year pillar is ruled by You, the earthly branch of the R ooster, you are an individual of 
appearances, reality, and emotion. Finely dressed and with a taste for pa geantry, the Rooster has 
a lively, outgoing manner and is an  efficient and methodical soul . You understand the concept of 
delayed gratification-how to work hard today while looking ahead toward tomorrow's rewards. 
Confident, resilient, and industrious, those souls born with a y ear pillar of the Rooster apply 
themselves cheerfully to practical projects. Enthusiastic about details others may have 
overlooked, Roosters prefer to give the orders rather than take th em. Roosters love to socialize 
and are at their best in a crowd. The assertive Rooster needs a strong and self-assured partner 
whom he or she can respect, such as the powerful Dragon, the handsome Snake, or the stable Ox. 
Wood Rooster 
The creative Wood element produces an imaginative and creative Rooster who is more efficient 
than most people. The adaptable Wood Rooster has a free and easy manner and a eye for color, 
style, and interior decorating. C onfident that their way is the right way, Wood Roosters have an 
ability to improvise in difficult situations. If this is your sign, you have a rich imagination that 
you often put to good use, particularly if you work in  the arts. Take refuge in nature in order to 
fulfill your need for liberty, space, and harmony. Your calm and collected demeanor makes you 
appear at ease; however, this self-assured at titude is a defensive mask behind which you 
skillfully hide your doubts and fears. The physical  organ of Wood is the liver; so avoid self-
medicating by drinking al cohol or overeating. 
Fire Rooster The impassioned Fire element makes for a firecrack er of a Rooster who warms, burns, animates, 
transforms, and overthrows. Fire in the R ooster augments this sign's passion, audacity, 
argumentativeness, and rashness. The quixotic Fire Rooster needs to be surrounded by flattery 
and applause. Warrior, statesman, emperor, or revolutionary, the Fire Rooster runs after ideals 
that he or she can seldom grasp. Gifted with a perplexing and powerful personality, you will 
evolve within a special universe, far from others and run-of-the-mill situations. You are likely to be lucid and clairvoyant; however, Fire is also a symbol of passion and violence, so you'll need 
to control your anger and aggressiveness lest th ey get out of hand. Fire  governs the heart and 
circulatory system, so reserve your strength and do not burn your  energy recklessly. Be careful 
of overwork and excesses of every kind. 
Earth Rooster 
With its caverns and buried treasures, the practical Earth element is very harmonious for the 
Rooster. The Earth Rooster is more realistic than the others, but also more materialistic, cautious, 
and skeptical. Earth Roosters reach their goals as a result of continual diligent efforts. For this 
Rooster, the Earth element symbolizes a safe de posit box rather than a refuge for meditation. A 
hard and conscientious worker, you enjoy accumula ting wealth and could be preoccupied with 
success, security, and appearances.  You may have a tendency to bury your treasures (so to speak) 
away from indiscreet glances and prying eyes. The organ of Earth is the sp leen, so be moderate 
with sweets, stay active, and watch a tendency to put on weight  after middle age. Metal Rooster 
The structured and defining Metal element bri ngs forth a Rooster who is the "sword that 
harvests." Organized, outspoken, and blunt, Metal Roosters implement plans of action and turn 
ideas into reality. They like to  take command and or ganize everything, leav ing little left to 
chance. They can also be rather fanatical about their work ethic, doi ng things correctly, and 
being punctual. Their lack of tact can sometimes jeopardize fragile negotiations. If this is your 
sign, a little flexibility could benefit you, as could more tenderness, subtlety, and diplomacy. 
Relax, be more flexible, and take time to play a bit. The organ of Metal is the lungs, so be 
diligent to get enough fresh air, be careful of breathing difficulties, and take good care of your 
respiratory system. 
Water Rooster The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element give s birth to a calmer, more reflective Rooster. 
The Water element subdues and subverts this sign's  native pride, turning it instead toward social 
causes. Water Roosters will ofte n be found embroiled in commun ity dilemmas as advocates of 
justice and/or as champions of improved social conditions. Water Roosters will succeed in any 
profession that demands self-assurance, nerve, and brilliance. Intelligen t and skillful, they know 
how to convince and persuade. If you are one of the adaptable Water Roos ters, you are able to 
create a special universe ar ound you by setting up a comfortable, harmonious, and organized 
home. The organ of Water is the kidneys, so be sparing with salty foods  and take good care of 
your kidneys and urinary system. 
The Dog (Xu 
 
Feb 4, 1934 to Feb 4, 1935: Wood Dog on guard Feb 4, 1946 to Feb 4, 1947: Fire Dog of dreams (sleep) 
Feb 4, 1958 to Feb 4, 1959: Earth Dog of the mountain Feb 4, 1970 to Feb 4, 1971: Metal Dog of gold bracelets 
Feb 4, 1982 to Feb 4, 1983: Water Dog of deep oceans 
Feb 4, 1994 to Feb 4, 1995: Wood Dog on guard 
Feb 4, 2006 to Feb 4, 2007: Fire Dog of dreams (sleep) Feb 4, 2018 to Feb 4, 2019: Earth Dog of the mountains If your year pillar is ruled by Xu, the earthly branch of the D og, you are a watchful worrier and 
champion of the little guy. Dogs are famous for complete loyalty toward their friends and loved 
ones, and intense ferocity toward the enemie s of their loved ones. Anxiety, loyalty, and 
protectiveness characterize the magnanimous Dog personality. Devoti on, generosity, and 
perseverance are the cornerstones of the anxiou s Dog's temperament. Earnest, sincere, and 
faithful to those they love, wary Dogs can ha ve sharp tongues and a tendency to jump to 
conclusions. Cautious and serious  regarding love, the Dog needs a trustworthy partner who has 
strong family sympathies and who appreciates the Dog's need for tenderness. Low on ego but 
high on their soapboxes, Dogs are known for their fair-minded humanitarianism. Just as a calm 
river and a violent torrent can spring from the same source, th ere are many different kinds of 
Dogs, but they all have wo rry and anxiety in common. 
Wood Dog 
The creative Wood element produces  a more serene Dog who is a lover of harmony, beauty, and 
elegance. The Wood element brings a peacefulness to the Dog's sometimes anxious personality. 
Socially popular and highly in tuitive, the Wood Dog is a seer  and prophet. The Wood Dog is 
also a seducer who is able to convince, confuse, and attract. If you are a Wood Dog, your subtle 
emotions make you well-suited for the arts and ot her creative endeavors. However, as with all 
Dog natives, you likely hide a lack of self-confiden ce behind a calm and relaxed exterior. This is 
a defensive reaction, as your overwrought imagina tion is adept at imagining the worst possible 
outcome in every scenario. Your charm lies in  your unaffected behavior and sincerity. Wood 
governs the liver, so avoid drinking alcohol. 
Fire Dog 
The impassioned Fire element makes for an ener getic Dog who is quite capable of taking on a 
leadership position. Always on tenterhooks, perpet ually agitated, and eternally unsatisfied, the 
Fire Dog is not easy to live w ith, however. Once they are convi nced of their position, nothing 
can make them change their mind. Indeed, with  their strong passions and sudden angers, some 
may think the Fire Dog impossible to please. Attract ed to mysticism, Fire Dogs are known to cut 
themselves off from the outside world and focu s exclusively on spiritua l practices. Some Fire 
Dogs choose to live completely isolated for a ti me. Fire is the yang, positive, masculine dayforce 
that animates, transforms, and quickens. For Dogs, Fire is the flame of energy and dynamism, a 
creative and stimulating force. If this is your  sign, you are an exceptional person? Make full use of your great potential. Fire gove rns the heart and circulatory system, so guard against high 
blood pressure, toxic anger, and excessive worry. 
Earth Dog The practical Earth element brings into being a sensible Dog who has all paws planted firmly on 
terra firma. This immovable sentry is activ e and honest, a conscien tious worker who is 
appreciated by superiors and subordinates alike.  Earth Dogs are concerned with the here-
andnow, and they obtain goals as a result of repeat ed and diligent efforts. If this is your sign, you 
are knowledgeable in your area of expertise. You are also shrewd and mature, and will give 
priority to the interest of the collective over your own. On th e downside, you can be troubled by 
anxiety and a fear of commitmen t, but contact with nature soothes your fears and doubts. The 
organ of Earth is the spleen, so be moderate with sweets and watch a tendency toward weight 
gain. 
Metal Dog 
The structured and defining Metal element brings forth an organized Dog who can be austere and 
verbally merciless. If there is a chink in someone 's armor, the Metal Dog will find it. Metal Dogs 
vacillate between beauty and material success on one hand; and spiritual preoccupations and 
death on the other. If you are a Metal Dog, you ma y be torn between worldly achievement and an 
internal, secret spiritual light . Metal Dogs are discerning and lucid, but cannot seem to avoid 
torturing themselves with burdens. Free yourself  by jettisoning the ir on collar of rules and 
regulations and the straightjacket  of dogmas that bind you. The organ of Metal is the lungs, so be 
diligent to get enough fresh air, be watchful for breathing difficulties, and take good care of your 
respiratory system. 
Water Dog The intuitive, deep, and placid Water element gi ves birth to a devout an d spiritually discerning 
Dog. Water soothes the inherent anxiety and dampens the aggressive impulses of this earthly 
branch. Natural warriors of righteous causes an d the heroes in difficult dilemmas, Water Dogs 
can be found in foreign countries as missionari es, doctors, nurses, and teachers. They are 
defenders of the peace, determined leaders, and humanitarians of the high est order. Water Dogs 
are humane and benevolent benefactors who ach ieve their goals through dogged perseverance. 
Excessive emotionality and passions  are often the result of this element and sign combination, as 
well. The organ of Water is the kidneys, so be sparing with sa lty foods and take good care of 
your kidneys and urinary system. 
The Pig (Hai)  
Feb 5 1935 to Feb 4, 1936: Wood Pig of travel and journeys 
Feb 5, 1947 to Feb 4, 1948: Fire Pig cresting the mountain Feb 5 1959 to Feb 4, 1960: Earth Pig of the monastery 
Feb 5, 1971 to Feb 4, 1972: Metal Pig of fine jewelry 
Feb 5, 1983 Feb 13 to Feb 4, 1984: Water Pig of the wide sea Feb 5, 1995 to Feb 4, 1996: Wood Pi g of travel and journeys 
Feb 5, 2007 to Feb 4, 2008: Fire Pig cresting the mountain Feb 5, 2019 to Feb 4, 2020: Earth Pig of the monastery 
If your year pillar is ruled by Hai, the ear thly branch of the Pig, you are considerate, 
longsuffering, and supremely honest. The unpretentious Pig makes a cheerful friend and sincere 
partner. Trusting Pigs are often betrayed or duped because of their faith in other people, but are eventually rewarded due to their sincerity a nd pure heart. Companionship, physical love, and 
emotional security are a must. These souls need an easy-going mate who talks out problems 
instead of shouting. Gentle yet strong-willed, Pigs are motivat ed by their conscience. They 
would never push themselves ahead at the expense of another. 
Wood Pig 
The creative Wood element produces a Pig who is a lover of peace, justice, and equality. This is 
an artistic Pig who loves travel and the splendor  of the outdoors. Nature, the woods, and scenic 
nooks unknown to others are all favorite haunts of  the Wood Pig. Those born with the Wood Pig 
as their year pillar prefer the country over the city, the arts over the world of  business, and their 
freedom over wealth. A structured bureaucratic society is the epitome of everything Wood Pigs detest. They prefer to be relaxed, simple, and some times even a little carele ss. If this is your sign, 
you may feel ill at ease and crampe d in a highly organized or rigid environment. The organ of 
Wood is the liver, so for optimum health it is best to limit alcoholic beverages and keep your 
emotions in perspective. 
Fire Pig The transforming Fire element makes for a Pig w ho is a reservoir of natural energy, audacity, 
and passion. The Fire Pig is more opinionated an d outspoken, and much more of a fighter than 
other Pigs. Intellectually curious, the Fire Pig is on a never-en ding quest for risk and novelty. 
This impulsive and big-hearted soul is a lover of mystery and some times a bit solitary. Fire Pigs 
can give of themselves while being utterly blin d to the consequences. Lucid, clairvoyant, and 
emotional, Fire Pigs reject mediocrity and c onventional ways of expressing themselves. Their 
bawdy sense of humor can be shocking in a ch arming kind of way. If this is your sign, you get 
around obstacles by relentlessly overthrowing them. Your Fire element also endows you with 
zeal and an enthusiasm for new ideas. The organ of  Fire is the heart and circulatory system, so 
curb your tendency toward aggressiveness and im pulsiveness, and try to keep your taste for 
dangerous enterprises in check. 
Earth Pig 
The no-nonsense Earth element brings into being a shrewd, sensible Pig who is concerned with 
realistic ideas and concepts. The Ea rth Pig tends to be an egotist, snug in his or her solitary lair. 
Male Earth Pigs in particular can resemble Mr. Spock in that they are calculating, logical, and 
careful. They will create detailed plans and proj ects, evaluating risks and weighing the pros and 
cons before making a decision. Their efforts are often devoted to accumulating wealth that they 
will then hide from the eyes of others. Female Earth Pigs appear to be submissive, but the reality 
is that they control from behind the scenes. This  is a stay-at-home, cozy Pig who prefers warm 
refuges over the aggressions of the outside world. Earth Pigs in general tend to be distrustful and suspicious, and are haunted by a fear of being ch eated. The organ of Earth is the spleen, so the 
Earth Pig should be moderate with sweets and watch a tendency toward inactivity and weight 
gain. 
Metal Pig 
The structured and defining metal element brings forth a self-confident Pig who does not seek 
solitude as other Pigs do, but rather walks in full daylight enjoying success and glory. Metal Pigs are energetic and ambitious, but their clear-sighte dness can sometimes be painful. Metal Pigs are 
galvanized by the mysteries of the soul and of  the subconscious. The Metal Pig is a scrupulous 
yet ambitious person who may sacrifice his or he r private life for materi al success. If you are a 
Metal Pig, humor is your best friend and defense against tragedy and misfortune. Surround yourself with positive, upbeat people, and rela x and give up chasing after inaccessible or 
"perfect" ideals. The organ ruled by the element of Metal is the lungs, so take good care of your 
respiratory system. Breathe deeply, seek the open air, sail a boat, or go climb a mountain. 
Water Pig The deep, calm, and composed Water element gi ves birth to a receptive and empathic Pig who 
knows how to listen. This is a mellow, reflective Pig who generally refrains from excess. Water 
Pigs are pacifists and humanists, and often have a fear of difficulties and confrontat ion. If this is 
your sign, a certain timidity and lack of self -confidence holds you back at times. Don't recede 
into the background-be less passive and take th e risk! Helpful, sympathetic, and honest, you can 
be encroached upon if you are percei ved as too passive, so don't get in the habit of giving more 
than you receive. The organ of Water is the kidn eys, so look after your spine and urinary tract 
system. Remain active to avoid putting on weight during midlife, and drink plenty of water to 
hydrate your body. 
  
 
  
The second pillar of destiny is the month pillar. Like the year pillar, it is composed of two 
Chinese characters that depict th e universal qi distinct to the month in which you were born. We 
can use the month pillar in our charts for a great deal of information and clarity. Using the 
software included, find your month pillar in the center of your Zi Wei Dou Shu chart. Find your

destined for greatness, but don't be impatient to  achieve your goals; a steady pace will insure 
success. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Ox : You are not the kind of  person who will settle 
for second best. You are determined to succeed in this life and are not bothered by what others 
think. When the stresses of work build up, exer cise is a good way to release them. When you 
make money you will keep it. Longte rm romances will be fortunate. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Ti ger: You are quite the individualist, a traveler 
who likes to travel the path least taken. Taking care of your home and family are very important 
to you, despite many ups and downs in love. You are noticed by superiors as a result of your 
shining abilities. Setting clear priorities and directions will help achieve your goals. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Rabb it: You are tolerant and sensitive, and dream of 
making a difference. You will most likely be te sted many times, but patience and learning to 
understand your priorities makes you stronger. Duty to family and to  responsibilities at work pull 
you in two opposite directions.

If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Horse: You have the gift of gab and can talk to 
anyone about almost anything. You are able to make people believe every word you say. Over 
time, more responsibilities will emerge, some mo re serious than you might anticipate. Romance 
finds you, and your loved ones go out of their way to please you. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Go at: You are an introvert and very cautious until 
you slowly get to know someone; once you do, you ar e friends for life. You will provide your 
children with whatever they need  and indulge them with  the finest you can afford. Financial luck 
is indicated. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Mo nkey: You love life and love to have fun? You 
will make a good leader if you don't take criticism personally. You have a flair for the dramatic. 
Roadblocks are lifted and opportun ities flow. Take care of financ ial responsibilities early on so 
that they don't come back to haunt you later on down the line. If the animal sign in your month p illar is the Rooster: You are anal ytical, with keen observational 
skills. Your patience will be tested many tim es, but you will analyze your way through it. As 
responsibilities increase, frustr ation rises, so take time to wind down and relax frequently. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Dog: You have a strong sense of duty and make 
sure those who rely on you have a safe have n. Decision-making can be hard with too many 
variables in mind. Opportunities abound, but pick and choose carefully. You search diligently for 
a soulmate. Don't let heartache early on spoil your desire, as true l ove comes later for you. 
If the animal sign in your month pillar is the Pig:  You have incredible insight into what others 
feel, but you tend to keep your emotions to  yourself. You can sometimes spend beyond your 
means and then suffer when it's time to pay. Try to heal yourself by conf ronting your past, and 
don't give more than you receive, as  this could become a heavy burden. 
After locating your month pillar in the center of the Zi Wei D ou Shu chart on the CD, find your 
life stage and your daymaste r (example: if your day pillar is th e Fire Horse, your element is yang 
Fire; if your day pillar is the Fire Rabbit, your element is yi n Fire.) Then, move down through 
the animal signs underneath and stop at the on e present in your mont h pillar. You will be 
comparing your daymaster element with the branch  (animal sign) of your birth month. Note what 
life stage you are in  (Childhood, Adolescence, Adulthood, Prime, Decline, Aging, Death, 
Dormancy, Void, Embryo, Pregnancy, or Birth) and look to the end of the chapter for the

Embryo 
If Embryo is your life stage, you are the youngest of souls and in the earliest stages of spiritual 
development. As such, you proceed through specif ic and recognizable stages of new beginnings 
in this life. According to legend, the fetus in the womb sees from  one end of the universe to the 
other, including the unborn's own deep past and his or her ultimate destiny. However, during the 
birth process, you experienced tota l forgetfulness of all knowledge of your pre-birth existence. If 
you are born into this earliest of the karmic life st ages, the purpose of your life is to recover this 
knowledge. Interested in all things new, you will possess a good sense of humor and enjoy 
helping people. Good luck surrounds you. Health is weak when young, but as you age, health 
improves. Those in this life phase like to know details and reasons for things and are optimistic 
about the future. 
Pregnancy 
If Pregnancy is your life stage, you are a very young soul. This will be a life of heightened 
spiritual awareness for you. During this lifetime,  you will often notice symbols or signs in your 
daily life which will provide you with needed information. Born  into this life stage, you 
experience vivid or prophetic dreams and often rely on your intuition or  inner knowing. You will 
have many questions about these spiritual experiences and may not understand what is 
happening. You may find yourself wondering if others have expe rienced the same types of 
things, and question if your own e xperiences are true and accurate.  Be accepting of the insights 
and information that these experiences provide . The physical form in which you find yourself 
during this lifetime will be the closest to the pure  essence of you-your spiritual self. You are the 
only soul with your particular "brand" of persona lity. You've recently come into being, and have 
now crossed over into physical form. You need a lot of energy and strong support from family, 
friends, and environment. Hard work pays o ff for you and you will be known as an honest and 
social person who is satisfied w ith your existence and lifestyle. 
Birth If Birth is your life stage, you are a relatively young soul. Born at  this time into physical form by 
human parents, you use your physical senses to take in the world around you. You are in a 
karmic stage of help and assistance to othe rs. Happiness, kindness, honesty, gentleness, good 
relationships, and popularity with others are the gifts of this life to you. A quick learner and 
highly intelligent, you will live a long life and ha ve many opportunities offered to you. Keep in 
mind that, spiritually speaking, you're still a ba by and learning sounds, shapes, emotions, and 
even words. You don't quite know who you are yet. Y ou're still learning the basics of life, such 
as right and wrong. You will be strongly attached to your parent(s) or guardian(s), as they were 
the first who provided your basic human needs. There will be gr adual growth and enjoyment of 
many (what seem like) new activiti es for you. Those in this life stage are easily influenced by 
others both positively and negatively, and will need inspiration and assistance to develop and 
mature. You will always need a stable partner in life and in love. 
Adolescence 
If Adolescence is your life stage, you are a younger soul. You are extremely energetic and 
imaginative and many times act with impunity, doi ng as you please. You're very self-expressive 
and creative; this will generally be a happy life for you. This is where you begin school, 
spiritually speaking. If you find yourself experiencing the Adolescent stage of the 12 life cycles, 
you are in a rebellious stage w ith unconventional thinking. You may have strained relations with 
your family early on, and consider yourself powerle ss to change the status quo-that is, until that 
fateful day when a spiritual force steps in a nd convinces you to take action. Naturally (or 
supernaturally), your actions result in an almost  miraculous improvement in family relations. 
You're in the puberty stage, spiritually, and are here to learn to clean  up your own messes and 
focus on learning about relationships, devel oping, maturing, and leading. You will use your 
intelligence to succeed and use verbal skills to the max. 
Adulthood 
If Adulthood is your life stage, you are to so me degree an experienced soul. You may be 
motivated early to start a relationship, get marrie d, and/or have children. You have a strong sense 
of security and are now focused on the assets of  others. You have the power to handle other 
people's belongings. It is quite possible that one of your relatives wi ll leave you with an 
inheritance. In this life cycle,  you are quite ambitious and passiona te, sexual and quite intense. 
Symbolically you are a vulnerabl e but world-weary young hero(ine) facing down the realities of 
a harsh world-but only for a time, after which ever ything that's confusing and uncertain turns out 
to be safe and welcoming in the end. Optimism,  faith in a power grea ter than yourself, and a 
certain resilience characterizes this life stage. You may find your self wanting recognition and 
fame; however, you will do better behind the scenes in  management or in any type of leadership 
role. An independent self-made person, you possess the potential for great pr osperity and success 
in this life. 
Prime 
If Prime is your life stage, you are an experienced soul. There is an old saying that youth is 
wasted on the young, the implication being that al though we are at our best physically in our youth, the young are still ine xperienced and are not able to take  advantage of their best years. 
This is not the case with you, as you have evolved to the point at which you are able to take 
advantage of all the benefits this life has to offer. At this stage, materialism is the greatest risk to 
spiritual development. If this is your life cycl e, you will most likely pursue higher education and 
a traditional relationship, and attain an ad mired career. Much of your focus will be on 
relationships. You appreciate your own beauty as we ll as the beauty of others. You're finally at 
the stage at which you have the personal confidence to act on your own, and the freedom to act as your conscience dictates. Ther e is a good probability for celebr ity and success in some form. 
Be cautious of becoming ove rconfident or overbearing. 
Decline 
If Decline is your life stage, you are a very expe rienced soul. You will ne ed a steady 9-to-5 job 
where the responsibilities end when the work day is  completed. At this stage, your inner spiritual 
self is daily becoming more mature and acquiring strength and renewal. The older you are, the 
better you become; during middle age in particul ar, when you are no longer making foolish, 
youthful decisions and are no longer governed by  youthful passions and indiscretions, you can 
finally be at your best. You are quite philosophical and work ha rd at your job. As you get close 
to retiring, you may feel  better than you did in your 20s. Because you may feel that you were 
born old, you'll likely not go through a midlife crisis. At that time, you will finally be comfortable in your own skin. Your parents are likely to have had a strong influence in your life, for good or for bad, and their passing may be par ticularly hard on you. Your  life situations tend 
to reach the top then turn back down again w ith some memorable peak s and valleys. You are a 
genuinely nice person, albeit a bit of a procrastinator, who needs a calm, steady life. This life 
stage has a passive influence. This could cause yo u to be hesitant to challenge authority. Take 
time for vacations with your family or spouse while you're young and enjoy old age, reflecting on these gratifying adventures. It ha s been said that the memories of a man in his old age are the 
deeds of a man in his prime. 
Aging If Aging is your life stage, you are an old soul . You will experience many changes in yourself 
and wear many hats during this lifetime. You are a multidimensional person in the process of 
physical, psychic, and spiritual transformation. Some dimensions of your life will grow and 
expand, while others will decline. Even during your youth, your reaction time may be slow, but 
your knowledge of world events and wisdom will be profound at times and greatly expanded. 
Even late in life, you will find that a new potential exists fo r physical, mental, and spiritual 
growth and development. Like a bristlecone pine  that has no cells older than 30 years, you will 
experience great longevity. However, you need a gentle and peaceful work environment without 
stress or pressure, and a calm and stea dy life course to accomplish your goals. 
Death 
If Death is your life stage, you ar e indeed an old soul. Death is separation. During th is life stage, 
you separate from the karmic patterns that  have bound you and held you back. You shed 
crippling fears, old ghosts, and hang-ups that will not be carried with you to the next existence. You are completing some very im portant soul-work. You are a rath er retiring person, a worrier, 
and susceptible to lethargy at times. You n eed energy, exercise, and good nutrition to achieve. 
You may not have a traditional career, but a series of  jobs that are only a means to be able to live 
the life you want. You will work to live rather than  live to work. Choose a profession in the arts 
or literature, not in business or management. Yo u may yearn for retirement at an early age. 
Although you are not particularly ambitious in th e traditional sense, you won't tolerate being 
cheated financially and will insist on receiving wh at you deserve. This life cycle can create a lot 
of problems in relationships. It is re commended that you marry late in life. 
Dormancy 
If Dormancy is your life stage, you are a very  old soul. Creatives, immortals, and famous 
philosophers find themselves born into this life stage. You are involved in a cycle in which 
growth, development, and even physical activit y can be temporarily suspended. This helps you 
conserve spiritual energy. You instinctually know how to start protecting yourself before the 
onset of adverse conditions, and are able to ente r into a recuperative phase afterward. This will 
happen when your life becomes unpredictable or when  the climate of a relationship changes very 
suddenly. These constant adaptations can lead to high stress levels. As an introvert, you enjoy 
doing anything indoors; you may take  pleasure in collecting things  and saving money. You are 
most likely cautious, quiet, and honest, but need to be motivated and exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking. Your mind has been liberated fr om worldly things; you f eel detached from "all 
that." You don't dwell on the past, but dream about the future. You'll likely be thinking about what your spouse or children will have received  from you, and also about your future in the 
spiritual realm. Ultimately, you want to be a sour ce of joy and hope, and share pearls of wisdom 
with your family and friends. In this life stag e, you'll want to offer your (now formidable) 
spiritual guidance. You're ready to  cross over into the hereafter. 
Void 
If Void is your life stage, you have completed th e other stages at least once and are an ancient 
soul. Kong (Chinese, "emptiness" or "nothingness";  ku in Japanese) one of the teachings of the 
Buddha, essentially means that form is impe rmanent and, hence, nothing possesses enduring 
identity. Exploring and understanding this "emptiness of phenomena" cultivates insight that will 
lead to wisdom and inner peace for you. This is a particularly important insight for those born 
into this karmic life cycle. Challenges for you can include emptiness, worry, impatience, 
hastiness, and an inability to complete projects. Poor planning can make you susceptible to being 
cheated or duped by others. Focus on being ca lm, careful, and mindful, or many problems and 
obstacles will surface. If you find yourself born into this life phase, symbolically you have 
crossed over into the spiritual real m. You realize that you are one in  a sea of infinite souls, and 
there are endless universal possibilities. You now have the power to control your spiritual 
journey or assist the journeys of others. This is also where you realize the importance of the 
physical journey. The cycle is complete and you can  begin it all over again, starting with rebirth. 
   
 
 
The day pillar, or daymaster, is perhaps the most important pillar of your birth chart. In Ba Zi, 
the heavenly stem (top element) of the day is called the daymaster. In a Ba Zi analysis, this 
daymaster is referenced against the birth year, m onth, and hour pillar to reveal your destiny and 
life path. The top element stem represents you-yo ur spirit and your qi. The bottom animal sign is 
your marriage/partnership branch. Using the softwa re included, find your day pillar in the center 
of your Zi Wei Dou Shu ch art and write it here:  
The element of your daymaster represents a speci fic energy. There are a total of 10 stems, or 
elements-five elements expressed twice, once in  a positive yang form and once in a negative yin 
form. 
The io Heaven[y Stems 
1. Jia Yang Wood: trees 
2. Yi Yin Wood: milled timber 3. Bing Yang Fire: lightning 
4. Ding Yin Fire: candle or incense 
5. Wu Yang Earth: hills 6. Ji Yin Earth: pottery/stoneware 
7. Geng Yang Metal: ore 
8. Xin Yin Metal: kettle 9. Ren Yang Water: saltwater 
10. Gui Yin Water: fresh water 
Within each of the 12 earthly branches (animal signs), there are one or more hidden stems, or 
elements, that will also become  part of your chart equation. 
The 12 Earthly Branches 
1. Zi Rat Water: North 2. Chou Ox Earth: North/Northeast 
3. Yin Tiger Wood: East/Northeast 
4. Mao Rabbit Wood: East 
5. Chen Dragon Earth: East/Southeast 6. Si Snake Fire: South/Southeast 
7. Wu Horse Fire: South 
8. Wei Goat Earth: South/Southwest 9. Shen Monkey Metal: West/Southwest 
10. You Rooster Metal: West 
11. Xu Dog Earth: West/Northwest 12. Hai Pig Water: North/Northwest 
These elements are able to combine or clash with other elements in a chart and it is this kind of 
interaction that allows an astrol oger to tell the story of your life. Each chart is as  unique as the 
person. Interpretations come from the other elements in the chart and how they act in relation to 
your daymaster, or self element. For example, the daymaster element can be supported or 
destroyed by other elements. Also, the day pillar  elements and animal branch signs may or may 
not be harmonious with those in the adjoining pillars.  
The element that is the same as your daymaster is its "friend" or "companion" element. This 
element represents your friends, colleagues, a nd siblings. The element that your daymaster 
produces is its "intelligence" or "wisdom" elemen t. This harmonious element will bring fame and 
recognition to you. The element that your daymaster is produced by is its "p arent" or "talent" 
element. Although this element is generally favor able, it can be either nurturing or smothering, 
depending on whether the yin/yang polarity is th e same as your daymaster or not. The element 
that controls your daymaster is its "proper discipline" or "amb ition/ career" element. This 
element will represent the husband for a female. For women, the spouse element is the same as 
the power element, which also represents control and status. The element that the daymaster 
controls is its "wealth" or "windfall" element. This element will represent the wife for a male. 
For men, the spouse element is the same as their wealth element. The element that produces your 
daymaster element is its "support" or "parent" el ement. This will be the element that nourishes 
and provides resources for you. 
According to the month (season) in which you we re born, your daymaster element will be rated 
as strong or weak. This has nothing to do with the strength or weakness of your character. 
Elements that are weak in a chart become lu cky when supplemented, and elements that are 
strong (overpowering) in a chart are unlucky and should be minimized. When we talk about the 
relative strength and weakness of daymasters, we  are talking about uni versal energy, tangible 
and intangible. If your daymaster element is Wo od, it will be strongest  if you were born in 
spring, and weakest in the fall. If your daymaster element is Fire, it  is strongest if you were born 
in the summer, and weakest in the winter. If your  daymaster element is Earth, it is strongest if 
you were born in between seasons or in late summer, and weakest during the winter/spring 
transition. If your daymaster element is Metal, it is strongest if you were born in the fall, and weakest during the spring. If your daymaster element is Water, it is strongest if you were born in 
the winter, and weakes t during the summer. 
Find your daymaster sign on pages 58 to 60 and read its description. 
 
 
 
  
The Wood element parallels the season of spri ng and represents the rising sun, the eastern 
direction, tall cylindrical shapes, and the colo r green. It corresponds to the liver, medicine, 
diseases, and the senses of si ght and hearing. Wood element peopl e renew their strength in the 
morning hours and are invigorated by the wind. The feng shui direction assigned to the Wood 
element is East, representing family, creativity, re lationships, and the slender, cylindrical forms 
of columns and towers. The Wood element represents the period from birth to age 12, a time of rapid mental and 
physical development, imagination, creativit y, simplicity, and compassion. Like the great 
sequoia tree, the nature of Wood is to move upward, spread outward, and expand toward the 
light. Its temperate nature is concerned with establishing goodwill, furthering the arts, and 
pursuing beauty. Wood element people have high-m inded values and believe in the dignity of 
every human being. They understand the value of  teamwork and excel in  organizing extensive 
and complex projects. Like their daymaster elem ent, those with a Wood daymaster know how to 
expand, achieve cooperation, and persuade others. They are progressive in their thinking and 
futuristic in their goals. The Wood element e ndows you with a natural presence and sense of 
propriety; however, Wood is also flammable a nd bestows a touchy temper. This is why the 
emotion associated with Wood is anger. The Wood element blesses you with idealism, 
imagination, a love of family, and many artistic  gifts. It is closely tied to the liver and 
gallbladder, and the senses  of sight and hearing. 
O Predominant senses: sight and hearing. 
O You produce/assist/help/feed: the Fire element. 
O You are produced/assisted/enabled by: the Water element. 
O Wood traits: kindness, generosi ty, creativity, expansion, but al so anger, apathy, hot temper. 
O Dangers: disease, rot, jaundi ce, insomnia, liver ailments. 
O Blessings: relationships, children, im agination, creativity, future vision. 
 
You are yang Wood Jia if your daymaster is  the Wood Rat, Wood Ti ger, Wood Dragon, Wood 
Horse, Wood Monkey, or the Wood Dog. Jia Wo od people are forward, stubborn, and constant, 
just like a tree growing slowly a nd surely straight up to reach th e sunlight. Jia Woods have strong 
willpower; in the face of adversity they don't give  up easily. They devise and plan their actions 
carefully, always moving toward a well-thought-out goal. The Jia Wood person is akin to the 
soaring California redwood, the solid oak tree, or the strong cherry tr ee. Jia Wood people are 
upright, dependable types whose gr eatest weakness is a lack of tact. You like to call a spade a 
spade each and every time. You are progressive and keen on self-cultivation, but like the slow-
growing tree, you take a long time to achieve your goals of self-improvement. Jia Woods are late 
bloomers and often look younger as they grow  older. Jia Woods are generally good at networking and have superior peopl e skills. Many Jia Woods were th rust into responsibilities at 
an early age and can have trouble adapting to co nflicting rules. You have a certain way of doing 
things and may resist changing your familiar ways. 
The Jia Wood man is a dependable fellow, a shoulder to cry on and someone you can always rely 
on for support. You can talk, and he'll listen. The Jia Wood man is always there for you, 
although you shouldn't expect him to be terribly usef ul in getting things done. He will be much 
better at just listening. The Jia Wood man is more pragmatic than romantic, and you should 
certainly not expect him to unders tand subtleties in matters of th e heart. In short, you may have 
to be blunt with him-or even do the proposing y ourself. Jia Wood men are the least amenable to 
any sort of change, so forget about modifying h im. Say "I do" rather th an "I will redo him." 
The Jia Wood woman can be quite stubborn and pr actical, and like her ma le counterpart, is 
unconcerned with the nuances and su btleties of romance. This is not  to say she doesn't like being 
wined and dined; she just prefer s it if you are upfront about your intentions . Persistence is the 
key to successfully winning her heart, as is an initial friendship. She will not play hard to get or 
be deliberately coy, but it takes a lo t to arouse her interest. You must be prepared to show a lot of 
persistence and staying power. The enlightened Jia Wood woma n is not entirely beyond change, 
but don't expect it to be a quick process. 
If you are yang Wood Jia: 
O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windfall element is yang Earth (Wu). O Your entitled, earned wealth/pro perty element is yin Earth (Ji). 
O Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yin Water (Gui). 
O Your beneficial, positive change /angel element is yin Metal (Xin). 
O Your unfavorable/conflic t/unbecoming/harmful elemen t is yang Metal (Geng) 
Because your daymaster element is yang Wood (Jia ), the element of Wood  represents you as 
well as your companions, spouse, and any riva ls you might have. Wood element years of the 
same polarity as your daymas ter (yang Wood 2004, 2014) complim ent and assist you, but Wood 
element years of the opposite polarity (yin Wood 2005, 2015) may bring competition, rivals, or 
challengers. The element of Earth represents your  finances. This element also represents your 
father. Yang Earth years (2008, 2018) bring unexpected or sudden wealth, and yin Earth years 
(2009, 2019) bring earned wealth. The element of  Water represents your mother. It also 
represents all caretakers, mentors, and pe ople who support or prot ect you. Yin Water years 
(2003, 2013) bring great happiness for you, and yang Water years (2002, 2012) bring a satisfied 
mind. The element of Fire represents your offspring as well as your ideas (your brainchildren). 
Both yang and yin Fire years (2006, 2007, 2016, 2017) will allow your optimum creativity and 
expression. The element of Metal represents your career or vocation. This is a difficult element 
for you. Yang Metal years (2000, 2010) bring unfavorable change, while yin Metal years (2001, 
2011) bring difficult yet beneficial change. If your daymaster is the Wood Rat, you are attrac tive and passionate, ready at a moment's notice 
to socialize and to transform your social milieu. Diligent, curious, and blessed with an inquisitive 
mind, you like to find out how things work. You ar e inclined to be carefree, but may have 
trouble with intimacy and experience a tumultuous love life. 
If your daymaster is the Wood Tiger, you are a good judge of characte r, street-smart, and 
understand the importance of teamwork. Noble, pr otective and popular with just about everyone, 
you change professions and employ ment frequently. The Wood Tige r will appear relaxed and at 
ease, but this is a mask behind which he or sh e hides an anxious nature. The stage attracts you 
and the limelight awaits you. If your daymaster is the Wood Dragon, you have a dual nature-dynamic and courageous on one 
hand, and seductive and appeasing on the other.  Imaginative and talented, you are able to 
improvise when faced with chaotic or unexpect ed events. This Dragon possesses the gift of 
creative invention and is attracted  to nature and symbols of beau ty. This is a practical Dragon 
who is less prone to having a heated temper, and whose feet are firmly planted on the ground. 
If your daymaster is the Wood Horse, you are a cheerful and cooperative team player. Changes 
and innovations capture your vivid imaginati on, and you possess a quick and disciplined mind. 
You are a progressive modern thinker and the most  social of all the Hors e element combinations. 
Amusing, a good conversationalist, and attracted to theater, you are a natural public speaker as 
well as a sports aficionado. If your daymaster is the Wood Monkey, you main tain high standards for yourself and others. 
You are resourceful and enthusiastic, but may ha ve trouble slowing down or pacing yourself The 
Wood Monkey is gregarious, socially adept, and quick-witted. Personal expression and a sense 
of humor are essential to you and you are an active  participant in life. Your curious mind excels 
at solving difficult problems and finding an easier wa y to do things. You are almost always able 
to find funds and resources. If your daymaster is the Wood Dog, you are aff ectionate, passionate, a nd known for your strong 
convictions. This is the team player of the Dog family. Idealis tic and eager to learn, the Wood 
Dog is popular and forms strong bonds with ot hers. This is a charming, personable Dog who 
defends his or her values with tenacity and vigor. Watchful and nurturing, Wood Dogs can 
organize major projects and manage large groups of people with ease. Th ey excel in motivating 
others. 
 
You are yin Wood Yi if your daymaster is the Wood Ox, Wood Rabb it, Wood Snake, Wood 
Goat, Wood Rooster, or Wood Pi g. Yi Wood grows toward the sun like a creeping vine or blade of grass. Yi Woods are adaptable and shrewd in  their dealings with people, and although they 
may appear indecisive, they know precisely what  they want and how to get it. Yi Wood people 
make good business owners as well as formidable competitors. Learned, intelligent, logical, and 
an original thinker, you may beco me absorbed in abstract trivia , proving your own theories, or 
counter-attacking criticism. Yi n Woods enjoy spending time al one in order to understand the 
world, clarify their thoughts, and prepare answer s to difficult questions. You always look for 
opportunities to learn, but it is knowledge for knowledge's sake, not necessarily knowledge that 
you will put to any practical use. Yi Wood is symbolized by ivy, creeping vines, flowers, grass, 
small plants, and ferns. Yi Woods are consumma te networkers; they entwine themselves with 
other people, ideas, and projects. Unenlightened  yin Woods can be manipulative and are not 
above using those around them to get what they desire. Yin Woods have an  innate understanding 
of the concept of leverage, and possess first-rate su rvival instincts. Dirt rarely sticks to them, 
thanks to their inherent charm and their pencha nt for ensuring they have enough wiggle room to 
get out of a jam. 
The term "femme fatale" best describes the yi n Wood woman. Once you succumb to her charms 
and she has you under her influence, you may find it difficult to escape. The yin Wood lady 
enmeshes herself with her man through a combination of charm, understanding, sexuality, and 
just the right dash of intellect ual challenge to keep him interested. Possessing a chameleonlike 
nature, the yin Wood lady frequently and rapidl y changes personality and appearance, thereby 
keeping her partner interested. She also has a knack for maki ng him feel good about decisions 
she has made for him? Romancing a yin Wood female requires regular professions of undying 
devotion, large amounts of affection,  and endless displays of loyalt y. She likes to feel as if her 
mate is her knight in shining armor and her love is still to be won. 
The yin Wood man is a marathon sort of guy, with a slow but sure hand. Charming, wellmannered, and polite, this smooth gentleman has been blessed with the gift of gab. The problem with him is that he can be capricious and fickle; when presented with many choices, he 
may have difficulty settling down with one part ner. A fear of commitment is not uncommon 
amongst yin Wood males. That is not to say that he  can't commit, but don't expect it to be easy to 
get him to agree to take the relationship to th e next level. The yin W ood man will always keep 
his options open. Alas, reasoning won't work with the yin Wood man, but giving him an 
ultimatum might be just the thing if you want him badly enough. 
If you are yin Wood Yi: 
O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windfall element is yin Earth (Ji). 
O Your entitled, earned wealth/pro perty element is yang Earth (Wu). 
O Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yang Water (Ren). 
O Your beneficial, positive change /angel element is yang Metal (Geng). 
O Your unfavorable/conflic t/unbecoming/harmful element is yin Metal (Xin). Because your daymaster element is yin Wood (Yi) , the Element of Wood represents you as well 
as your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Wood element years of the same 
polarity as your daymaster (yin Wood 2005, 2015) compliment and assist you; however, Wood 
element years of the opposite polarity (yang Wood 2004, 2014) may bring competition, rivals, or challengers. The element of Earth represents your  finances. This element also represents your 
father. Yin Earth years (2009, 2019) bring `unexpected' or sudden wealth, and yang Earth years (2008, 2018) bring earned wealth. The element of  Water represents your mother. It also 
represents all caretakers, mentors, and pe ople who support or prot ect you. Yin Water years 
(2003, 2013) bring great happiness for you, and yang Water years (2002, 2012) bring a satisfied 
mind. Water is an auspicious element for you, as  it nurtures and supports your Wood element 
daymaster. The element of Fire represents  your offspring as well as your ideas (your 
brainchildren). Both yang and yin Fire  years (2006, 2007, 2016, 2017) will allow optimum 
creativity and expression. The element of Metal represents your career or vocation. This is a

passive and cannot live wit hout physical love. The Wood el ement may encourage you to 
overindulge in both food and drink, so be moderate.

You are yang Fire Bing if your daymaster is the Fi re Rat, Fire Tiger, Fi re Dragon, Fire Horse, 
Fire Monkey, or Fire Dog. Yang Fire is symboli zed by a burning furnace or raging forest fire. 
Bing Fire people are the conquering heroes of the 10 daymasters. St rong, assertive, and lovers of 
a challenge, Bing Fires are natural leaders, cham pions of causes, and righters of wrongs. The 
driving force behind this persona lity is a fear of weakness or being dominated. Generous, 
vivacious, and as warm and pa ssionate as the sun itself, Bing Fire produces people who have no 
hidden agenda and do not hold grudges. They are upright and noble in thei r actions, but can also 
be proud and selfcentered, as well. Bing Fire is the fire of the s un-warming, radiant, and essential 
to the growth of all living things. Bing Fire people are magnanimous, generous, and giving, and 
will have a cause that they support or contribute to generously. Like  the sun that rises in the east 
and sets in the west, Bing Fire people are very  routine-driven until they hit a plateau. Life is 
never dull with Bing Fires, as they  are fiercely independent. The key to their happiness is to give 
them their own space to shine,  literally and figuratively. 
The Bing Fire woman is the person ification of the modern independe nt female. She is rarely in a 
hurry to marry and may find herself ill-suited to a traditional relationship. Bing Fire ladies who 
wish to marry should settle down only after they have fulfilled their life dreams. The Bing Fire female becomes bored easily and craves exci tement, new thrills, and amazing experiences. 
Diversity and novelty are vital for her psychological well-being, and her partner must be able to 
keep things fresh and interesting for her. Travel  is always a good idea, preferably on a more or less regular basis. If her partner always keeps life interesting for her and gives her space, they 
stand a good chance of having a successful relationship. At the very least, she will keep the home 
fires-and his love  life-burning. 
The Bing Fire man is warm, generous, and fun to be around. Like his Fire sisters, he, too, needs 
his own space and independence, which sometimes makes him reluctant to commit. There is also 
a tendency to be a bit too fe rvent and passionate, and to su rround himself with like-minded 
people. A relationship with a Bing Fire man is a very sensual one, and of ten the connection is on 
every level-emotional, physical, and spiritual. Ho wever, be warned that his passion has another 
side. The Bing Fire man can be quite aggressive  in his approach and is not above emotional 
bullying to achieve his goals. Uncompromising a nd demanding, the Bing Fire male is akin to a 
burning furnace or a raging forest Fire in his met hodology. In order to keep things interesting, it 
is essential to keep his interest in the bedroom and arrange plen ty of one-on-one time together. 
If you are yang Fire Bing: 
• Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windfall element is yang Metal (Geng). 
• Your entitled, earned wealth/property element is yin Metal (Xin). • Your happiness/guardian/proper care element is yin Wood (Yi). 
• Your beneficial, positive change/a ngel element is yin Water (Gui). 
• Your unfavorable/conflict/unbecoming/ha rmful element is yang Water (Ren). 
Because your daymaster element is yang Fire Bing, the element of Fire represents you as well as 
your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Fire element years of the same polarity 
as your daymaster (yang Fire 2006, 2016) complimen t and assist you; however, Fire element 
years of the opposite polarity (yin Fire 2007, 2017)  may bring competition, rivals, or challengers. 
The element of Earth represents your offspring as  well as your ideas (you r brainchildren). Both 
yang and yin Earth years (1998, 1999, 2008, 2009, 2018, 2019) will facilitate optimum creativity and outward expression. The element of Water repr esents your career or vocation. This is a very 
difficult element for you, as wate r extinguishes and controls your Fire element daymaster. Yang 
Water years (2002, 2012) bring unfavorable cha nge, while yin Water years (2003, 2013) bring 
beneficial change. The Element of Wood represents your mother. It also repr esents all caretakers, 
mentors, and people who support or  protect you. As Wood is the "p arent" element to Fire, yin 
Wood years (1995, 2005, 2015) bring happiness and nurtu ring. The element of Metal represents 
your finances. This element also represen ts your father. Yang Metal years (2000, 2010, 2020) 
bring a windfall of unexpected or sudden w ealth, and yin Metal years (2001, 2011, 2021) bring 
earned or expected wealth. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Rat, you are ent husiastic regarding new projects, but must guard 
against having too many irons in the fire at one time. You are determined and self-disciplined, 
with strong moral principles and high-minded th inking. As an eternal student of the universe, 
you thirstily absorb knowledge just as a sponge soaks up water. Consequently, you are well-versed in a wide variety of s ubjects. The Fire Rat is assertiv e by nature and capable of self-
confident leadership as well as offering prudent advice. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Tiger, you may find it hard to delay gratif ication; patience isn't 
necessarily your strong point. Howe ver, you have been blessed with extraordinary leadership 
aptitude. Fire Tigers are volatile  and passionate in life and in l ove. Your charm is that you are 
always up for a new adventure. You are acti on oriented and passionate? Rather nomadic by 
nature, you will choose frequent changes of envir onment and will rarely be content staying any 
one place too long. You are the most independent member of the Tiger's pride. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Dragon, you have a tremendous desire to succeed and are more 
ambitious than other Dragons. You are articul ate and knowledgeable about everything from 
politics to Shakespeare. No one knows from day to day what you will be up to: "unpredictable" 
describes you to a T. Mysterious, a natural thespian, and a born leader, you will be happiest 
being in the public eye in some way. You ar e strong-willed and te nd to rely on your own 
judgment without taking others' views into accoun t. Humility and patience may be difficult for 
you as it is admiration that you seek. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Horse, you are the most ardent and impetuous of all Horse element 
combinations. You may make your mark early in  life and exhibit your ta lents in astonishing 
ways. You have been endowed with superior wisdom, but perseverance may be difficult. You 
display above-average qualities of  leadership and can easily rally  others to your causes. With 
your heightened need for social interaction, you will tend to gravitate  toward outdoor team 
sports. You belong to the palace of sexuality, so  the pursuit of romantic love will be a dominant 
theme throughout your life. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Monkey, you are a problem-solver and a self-starter. Competitive 
and popular, you have a wide variety of inte rests and friends from diverse backgrounds. 
Energetic and animated, you are convincing, res ourceful, and highly complex. The Fire element 
imparts great vitality and good health to you, but could also consume much of your energy. Your 
fertile imagination produces an ingenious, albeit suspicious personality who will always look for 
a quicker and easier way to do things. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Dog, you have no problem expressing yourself and connect easily 
with others. You may choose to go into politic s or the entertainment industry. Opinionated, 
dynamic, and radiant with energy, you may seem a bit too animated to outsiders, who are always 
surprised at how outspoken you are. Your friendly personality conceals a self-effacing and 
anxious spirit. Possessing great charm, you st and your ground and are severe only when 
diplomacy has failed. 
 
You are yin Fire Ding if your daymas ter is the Fire Ox, Fire Rabbit,  Fire Snake, Fire Goat, Fire 
Rooster, or Fire Pig. Yin Fire is symbolized by soft candlel ight, twinkling stars, and the 
illumination of the full moon. Ding Fire people are naturally influent ial and motivate those 
around them with an inspired sense of humor. Th ey are meticulous and detail-oriented, but due 
to their helpful nature, they can forget about their own need s and be susceptible to burnout. 
Those with a yin Fire daymaster are inspir ational, wise, conscientious, idealistic, and 
hardworking. A bit perfectionistic at times, they  are bothered when things are not done the right 
way (read: their way). When frustrated, they may become critical of others and of themselves. 
Their underlying motivation is to avoid anger an d avoid being wrong or cr iticized. However, few 
things or people in this life are perfect, so life is rarely easy for them. Like the tiny flame that can 
either flare up into a great fire or burn down into  embers, Ding Fire people can either rise to the 
occasion or hide in the shadows, waiting for th e right opportunity to shine again. Ding Fire 
people can be temperamental, fickle, sensitive, a nd prickly at times, but they are always thinking 
about others first. They often need to be reminde d that they must sometim es come first. Whether 
male or female, the Ding Fire person will always hold his or her mother in great regard. 
If you wish to seduce a Ding Fire lady, make sure you are on good terms with her mother. If her 
mother likes you, all will go well when it come s to dating a Ding Fire woman. The Ding Fire 
lady is usually a night owl so nocturnal activities usually appeal to her, especially late-night 
romantic diners, movies, or stargazing. She is st rongly attracted to self-i mprovement, alternative 
ideas, and education, so make cultural and intell ectual activities and conversations part of your 
life together. An art gallery, the theatre, or even a wine-tasting outing might be just what she had 
in mind. The Ding Fire female is not likely to share he r life with a rude, crude, or uncouth man, 
so be courteous, be on time, and don't pressu re her. These are the keys to her heart. 
Like his Ding Fire sisters, the Ding Fire male  has a very close bond with his mother. Prideful, 
and concerned with his image and reputation, he dislikes being challenged or shown up in front 
of others. Self-knowledge and person al cultivation is very important to him, so it is crucial that 
you are able to keep up with him in this regard. The Ding Fire male usually has an extensive library and enjoys reading. He loves learning and considers himself something of an intellectual. 
His partner may be very beautiful, but if she isn' t able to hold an inte lligent conversation with 
him, the long-term prospects for the relationshi p are not good. He searches for a mature woman 
who is sensible and nurturing. 
If you are yin Fire Ding: 
O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windf all element is yin Metal (Xin). 
O Your entitled, earned wealth/prope rty element is yang Metal (Geng). 
O Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yang Wood (Jia). 
O Your beneficial, positive change /angel element is yang Water (Ren). 
O Your unfavorable/conflic t/unbecoming/harmful element is yin Water (Gui). Because your daymaster element is yin Fire Ding, the element of Fire represents you as well as 
your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Fire element years of the same polarity 
as your daymaster (yin Fire 2007, 2017) complimen t and assist you, while Fire element years of 
the opposite polarity (yang Fire 2006, 2016) can bring competition, rivals, or challengers. The 
element of Earth represents your offspring as we ll as your ideas (your br ainchildren). Both yang 
and yin Earth years (1998, 1999, 2008, 2009, 2018, 2019) wi ll facilitate optimum creativity and 
outward expression. The element of Water represen ts your career or vocation. This is a very 
difficult element for you, as wate r extinguishes and controls your Fire element daymaster. Yin 
Water years (2003, 2013) bring difficult or unfavor able changes for you, while yang Water years 
(2002, 2012) bring beneficial or needed change. The element of Wood represents your Mother. It also represents all caretakers, mentors, a nd people who support or protect you. Yang Wood years 
(1994, 2004, 2014) bring happiness for you, as Wood is your Fire daymaster's "parent" element. 
The element of Metal represents your finances. This element also represents your father. Yin 
Metal years (2001, 2011) bring a wi ndfall of unexpected or sudden wealth, while yang Metal 
years (2000, 2010) bring earned or expected wealth. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Ox, you are a conq ueror and may be drawn to politics or perhaps 
even the military. You are talented with your hands and highly creative. You also have 
tremendous reserves of energy, which can make you impatient to reach your goals. Delegate some responsibilities to others, avoid becomi ng exhausted, and respect your body's limits. The 
Fire Ox is fiercely individualistic yet feels a strong sense of filial duty. Although you are highly 
family oriented, you will always be the king or queen of your castle. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Rabbit, you have a tendency to keep your distance, especially if you 
feel rejected or excl uded. Although you personify the essence of detachment, the Fire element 
releases a boldness in you that can overcome th is natural reticence. The Fire Rabbit has a deep, 
profoundly spiritual side and will al ways burn with an inner flame.  Fire enhances your sense of 
touch vis-a-vis your most intima te relationships. You are a natu ral healer, counselor, or reiki 
master who knows the wisdom of gaining strength through accepting one's weakness. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Snake, you are a sensual, compassionate, and contemplative 
individual. You earn respect and win support from others with your  firm yet calm manner. Those 
with this daymaster are healt hy, vital, and confident enough to get any job done. The Fire Snake 
tends to be outgoing and energetic, and enjoy sports and "woodsy" outdoor activities. You 
possess an excellent sense of humor, will enjoy a wi de circle of friends, and could live to a very 
old age. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Goat, you are blesse d with extraordinary artis tic talents. A natural 
writer, poet, and artisan, you ar e expressive and passionate an d form close bonds with other 
people. Generous to a fault and charismatic amongst your peers, you inspire other people with 
your art. You are as charming as you are self-indulgent and manipulative. 
If your daymaster is the Fire R ooster, you are lively, inte nse, and energetic. Always the first one 
to jump on a task that needs doing, you may have  difficulty staying on one subject. Indeed, you 
are known to have many projects in the works at one time. The Fire Rooster is self-assured and 
determined, as well as expressive and brutally  candid with his or her observations. The Fire element imparts great vitality and a highly compe titive nature. Mercurial,  zealous, and efficient, 
you are strong-willed and capable of be ing either enchanting or unbearable. 
If your daymaster is the Fire Pig, you are fun-loving, self-assured, alluring, opinionated, 
adventuresome, and radiant with energy. You ma y be very fortunate financially due to a 
combination of ambition and purity of heart. Fire  also bestows leadership  abilities and bravery; 
many Fire Pigs choose to work as fi refighters, police officers, or EMTs. 
The Earth element parallels the periods between the seasons, the last days of each season, the 
Center, flat shapes, and the colo r yellow. It corresponds to the digestive system, the mouth, and 
the spleen. Fire element people renew their strength in the late after noon and during the periods 
between seasons, and are invigorated by their ke en sense of taste. The feng shui direction 
assigned to the Fire element is the Center, wh ich represents practicality, endurance, and flat, 
square shapes. 
The Earth element represents the period of life from ages 25 to 36, the young adult period 
characterized by stability, reliability, productivity, and common sense. The nature of Earth is to 
stabilize, to keep whole, and to  preserve. The Earth element is symbolic of the mother's protected 
womb of peace and safety. Those with an Earth da ymaster are practical and sensible. They have 
excellent organizational abilities and are competen t leaders and executives. Stability, practicality, 
and reliability characterize those influenced by the Earth element. Its natives are capable of 
making wise and sensible decisions, and tend to be conservative and serious. Earth element natives are firmly anchored to their family, their partnerships, and their homeland. The Earth element keeps both your feet firmly planted on th e ground and gives you the innate tenacity that 
allows you to complete arduous tasks. However,  Earth daymasters can also produce obstinate 
and unbendable individuals. The emotion associated with Earth is melancholy/depression, which may make you seem distant or unapproachable. Li ke the rocks that make up a wall or the soil 
that produces food, Earth element people are traditiona l, firm, and persistent. The Earth is closely 
tied to the stomach and the mouth. 
O Predominant sense: taste. 
O You produce/assist/help/f eed: the Metal element. 
O You are produced/assisted/enabled by: the Fire element.

You are yang Earth Wu if your daymaster is th e Earth Rat, Earth Tige r, Earth Dragon, Earth 
Horse, Earth Monkey or Earth D og. Wu Earth is symbolized by mountains, rocks, boulders, and 
passageways. Wu Earth people are as solid, immovable, and unwav ering as the mountains. They 
make trustworthy, loyal, and dependable friends. Simple and down-to-earth, Wu Earths are quiet 
and prefer solitude. Once they have made up their mind, they can be quite stubborn in carrying 
out their decisions. The Wu Earth personality is a solid one, often slow to take action and of few 
words. They are ponderous, quiet types who of ten need to be motivated to take action. 
Procrastination is a pesky problem with Wu Eart hs. Superb at keeping secrets, the Wu Earth 
person is the soul of discretion. When they are feeling effusive, however, they are chatty, jolly, 
fun people to be around. Sometimes accused of being hedonistic and wanting the best of 
everything, this yang Earth personality may become  materialistic and incl ined to buy new toys. 
Their major fears are deprivation and boredom, an d their compulsions involve avoiding pain and 
having more of everything. 
The Wu Earth lady is usually cu rvaceous with an air of mystery that surrounds her. Mature, 
appealing, and not one to be taken lightly, she may be slow to act unless she's on a mission, at 
which point there is little that can stop her. It takes a lot to  provoke a Wu Earth woman-unless 
she finds out you've been cheating on her? Co mmunication isn't her strong point, so getting 
through to her can be a challenge. She is stubborn  and difficult to dissuade once she has made a 
decision, so if she's laid down the law to you, don't expect her to change her mind easily. 
Outdoorsy, thrill-type activities usually appeal to her, but she often needs some initial prodding to get out there. Once she does,  she'll soon see the fun in some whitewater rafting or rock 
climbing. 
The Wu Earth male personifies th e strong silent type. Like his si ster Wu Earth, he often has a 
great deal of mystery surrounding him. His past is mysterious and his thoughts are deep. The 
Yang Earth male can also be extr emely stubborn. He's also a proc rastinator who doesn't usually 
like to participate in physical sports  or a lot of activity; he prefers to keep his feet planted firmly 
on the ground. He loves nothing more than having  a day to himself, reading a book or working 
on his prized model collection. The Wu Earth male has trouble expressing his deep feelings; it 
takes him a long time to collect his thoughts, much  less write them down on paper. His actions 
speak louder than his words, so take your cues from what he does rather than what he says. 
If you are yang Earth Wu: 
• Your sudden, unexpected wealth/wi ndfall element is yang Water (Ren). 
• Your entitled, earned wealth/prope rty element is yin Water (Gui). 
• Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yin Fire (Ding). 
• Your beneficial, positive change /angel element is yin Wood (Yi). 
• Your unfavorable/conflict/unbecoming/ha rmful element is yang Wood (Jia). 
Because your daymaster element is yang Earth Jia, the element of Earth represents your artistic 
expression as well as your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Yang Earth years 
(2008, 2018) bring friendships and new compan ions, but yin Earth years (1999, 2009, 2019) can 
bring contenders or competition. The element of Water represents your finances as well as your father. Yang Water years (2002, 2012) bring unexp ected or sudden wealth, and yin Water years 
(2003, 2013) bring earned or expected wealth. Th e element of Wood represents your career or 
vocation. This is a difficult element for you, as the Wood element saps the nutrients from your 
Earth daymaster. Yang Wood years (2004, 2014) bri ng difficult or unfavorable change, while yin 
Wood years (2005, 2015) bring beneficial change. The element of Fire represents your mother as 
well as all caretakers, mentors, and people who support or protect you. Yin Fire years (2007, 
2017) bring a satisfied mind for you, and yang Fire years (2006, 2016) bring ha ppiness, as Fire is 
the "parent" element to your Earth daymaster. The element of Metal represents you as well as 
your ideas (your brainchildren). Both yang and yin Metal years (2010, 2011, 2020, 2021) will 
facilitate optimum creativity and expression. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Rat, you have re markable willpower and a nurturing, downto-earth 
temperament. Sensible and alert, you also have a tendency to worry about security and finances. 
The Earth element makes you especially prudent, crafty, and subtle. Always keep yourself busy 
to keep from dwelling on problems or becoming mired in life's dramas. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Tiger, you like to nurture helpless things such as babies, stray 
animals, and sad friends down on their luck. Deep ly conscientious and humanitarian in spirit, you embrace a practical approach in everything you undertake. The Earth Tiger is not as 
hotheaded as other Tigers, and possesses a more mature temperament. This daymaster 
personifies a fair-minded l eader, counselor, or judge. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Dragon, you enjo y accumulating wealth and financial speculation. 
A conscientious and hard worker, the Earth Dragon  takes on chores and problems that others find 
impossible to conquer. Prudent and suspicious, you probably have eyes in the back of your head 
and miss nothing. This is a nurturing soul who is always willing to help out in a crisis and 
fiercely protective of family and loved ones. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Horse, you probabl y enjoy speculation, sales, or real estate. A 
conservative realist by nature, you know how to  advance prudently and skeptically. Your 
methodical manner would make you an excellent  manager. You may have a tendency to be 
possessive and are very security conscious. If your daymaster is the Earth Monkey, you are mo tivated by a need to expand and a desire for 
increasing possessions. Well-informed, benevol ent, and kind, you are also pragmatic and 
realistic. Although you hide your fears about the future behind a stoic face, most of your 
enterprises will be blessed due to your intu ition, your perfectionism, and your good head for 
money. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Dog, you jealou sly protect your home and loved ones. Although 
you are an extremely proud person, you can be counted  on to be a fair and impartial mediator. 
Your powerful need for recognition and apprec iation makes you capable of devoting yourself 
entirely to a cause or to achiev ing your ambitions. You are patient  in the face of difficulty but 
may be taken advantage of due to an exceedingly generous nature. 
 
You are yin Earth Ji if your daymaster is the Ea rth Ox, Earth Rabbit, Earth Snake, Earth Goat, 
Earth Rooster, or Earth Pig. Ji Earth is symbolized by the soft, rich, nourishing soil in which we 
grow our food. Nurturing, tolerant, and resourceful, Ji  Earths are also avid and materialistic. This 
daymaster produces a dependable, likable, enga ging person who makes a good friend. Ji Earth's 
instinct is to protect,  nurture, and develop. Rejection, lonesomeness, and condemnation from an 
authority figure are especially troubling to Ji Earths. They follow the rules and prefer the 
approval of others. Yin Earths can also be secretive due to Earth' s ability to keep things hidden. 
This makes them natural confidants and confessors. Tolerant and occasionally guilty of being too giving, Ji Earth people have many hidden talents 
and abilities which often come to the forefront gradually and organically, just as a seed grows into a plant. Ji Earths often have an inborn aptitude for handling money and strong 
entrepreneurial inclinations. On the negative flipsi de, they can sometimes ha ve trouble with their 
finances, as well. 
The monogamous Ji Earth female is focused and di sciplined in life and in love. Ji Earth women 
are generally in favor of marriage, family, and commitment. They seem to thrive in a committed 
relationship. Even when she is a ttached, however, the Ji Earth lady will always have her secrets. 
It is important to respect her pr ivate side and trust that she will eventually emerge and share her 
secrets with you when she is ready. Ji Earth ladi es love a good project th at they can pour their 
nurturing inclinations into, be it  reforming your table manners, turning your old wardrobe upside 
down, or talking you into fi xing the broken garage door. 
The Ji Earth man is usually quiet and unassuming, but there is often a great talent within him that is waiting to emerge and blossom. They are of ten very attractive to women because of their 
trustworthy demeanor. The Ji Earth man is co mforting to have around during a crisis. He is 
seldom bossy; rather, he will endeavor to guide  you to find your own solutions to a problem. 
This is a man who should not be pressured into a relationship that he is not ready for. The Ji 
Earth man can crumble under this kind of pressu re. Be gentle, be kind, and be a good listener-

If you are yin Earth Ji:

• Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yang Fire (Bing). 
• Your beneficial/positive change/a ngel element is yang Wood (Jia).

your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Yin Earth years (1999, 2009, 2019) bring friendships and new companions, but yang Earth years (2008, 2018) can bring 
"contenders" and competition. The element of Water  represents your finances and your father.

Both yang and yin Metal years (2010, 2011, 2020, 2021) will see your optimum creativity and 
expression. If your daymaster is the Earth Ox, you are a deep thinker who tends to be a loner. Loyal, 
steadfast, and stoic, your highest  priorities are family, monog amy, and duty. The Earth itself 
serves as your refuge; it entices you to close the door on the human race and pursue meditation, 
relaxation, and solitude. Enduring and persistent , slow and sure, you are a marathon runner in 
this life. You pace yourself and therefore have staying power in any endeavor, be it a 
relationship, a job, or a project.

extremely private, you are respected and held in high esteem by others. You are known for your

the material comforts of life. You posses an unca nny ability to turn inward and retreat from the 
outside world. You are a deeply feeling individual  who is, for the most part, relaxed, at times 
even lethargic. In fact, you may be prone to "h ibernation" and could choo se a reclusive life of 
spirituality and contemplation. 
If your daymaster is the Earth Goat, you are financ ially fortunate and have  a taste for luxury and 
the finer things in life. Sympathetic, hone st, and well-liked, you can, however, exhibit 
unpredictable moods and mental pr ocesses. Inconsistent and unconventional, the Earth Goat 
daymaster reveals an artistic a nd deep-thinking soul who lives in  a world of dreams, fantasy, and 
whimsy. Detached and distracted, you may not be as outgoing as you would like; you could even 
suffer from social anxiety at times.

uncanny ability to build upon the work of ot hers, improving on it and adding the finishing 
touches. You have a profound perspective on life and are able to see the bi g picture. Persistent 
and persevering, you pursue success and security, a nd are always intent on presenting a positive

of life-good food, good drink, and good company. You are sensual and soft-spoken, but inwardly 
strong and self-sufficient. You may express your artistic leani ngs and talents through practical 
and pragmatic avenues such as computers. Although you may seem submissive, you control

domes.

qualities. The Metal element symbolizes clear thinking, sincerity, and accuracy. Metal element

independent, solitary, and blessed with a great st rength of purpose, Metal element people tend to 
speak candidly and bluntly. The emotion associated  with Metal is grief, which can turn into

You are yang Metal Geng if your daymaster is th e Metal Rat, Metal Tige r, Metal Dragon, Metal 
Horse, Metal Monkey, or Metal Dog. Yang metal is  symbolized by iron ore, knives, swords, and 
axes. Geng Metal people come into this world as  a blank slate ready to be written upon by the 
hand of the universe. Through discipline, focus, a nd even hardship, they emerge as solid, sharp 
personalities with a strong drive to succeed at  all costs. Perfectioni sm is their need and 
responsibility is their creed. Geng Metal people place a high premium on justice, equality, and 
loyalty. Though they may complain bitterly about a decision or situation, th ey are also willing to 
roll up their sleeves and do something about it. Ge ng Metals have a tough constitution and will 
usually outtalk and outperform most of their co mpetitors. Loyal, stubborn, and most definitely 
persistent, they will defend their home, their coun try, and those they care for to the death. Able 
to endure hardships that would crush weaker sp irits, Geng Metals are sharp, determined, strong-
willed, and straightforward. They do not admit failure easily and define themselves by their 
strong sense of justice and fair play. 
The Geng Metal female is a go-getter. Confident, ambitious, and inspiring to  others, she can also 
become overly competitive due to a powerful need  to succeed. Always wanting to come out on 
top, she attempts to impress others as a protec tive mechanism to avoid failure and rejection. She 
can probably outdrink, outrun, and outwit you-and anyone else, for th at matter. Despite all this, 
she is still quite feminine, but don't be fooled by her pretty exterior: be neath the surface she's 
solid steel. Subconsciously she believes that her personal worth is determined by her 
achievements. She will frequently be found in profe ssions that are held in high esteem, such as 
the healing arts, emergency work, social servi ces, or perhaps championing the rights of children 
or animals. Although she will prove to be the most stubborn woman you have ever loved, she 
will also be endearingly loyal to you. 
The Geng Metal man has a tough constitution and you will need to be able to go the distance 
with him. Vigorous, brave and decisive, he posse sses an imposing kind of authority. He loves a 
challenge and never shrinks from hardships. Additionally, he upholds justice and has a high 
tolerance for external pressures. However, his thirst for challenges can make him seem rather 
imposing and off-putting to others. He is driven by  a need to succeed and to outshine rivals at all 
costs. He wants nothing more than to feel useful to you and able to do things for you, so never overdo the "strong, independent woman" role. The going is always tough at  first with the Geng 
Metal male, but once he warms to you, it wi ll be more than worth your trouble. 
If you are yang Metal Geng: 
O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windfall element is yang Wood (Jia). 
O Your entitled, earned wealth/pro perty element is yin Wood (Yi). 
O Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yin Earth (Ji). 
O Your beneficial/positive change/a ngel element is yin Fire (Ding). 
O Your unfavorable/conflic t/unbecoming/harmful element is yang Fire (Bing). 
Because your daymaster element is yang Metal Geng, the element of Metal represents you as 
well as your companions, spouse, and any rivals you might have. Yang Metal years (2000, 2010, 
2020) bring friendships and ne w companions; however, yin Metal years (2001, 2011, 2021) can 
bring "contenders" and drain resources. The elemen t of Earth represents your Mother. As Earth 
is your "parent" element, Earth elemen t years (2008, 2009, 2018, 2019) bring caretakers, 
mentors, and persons who support or protec t you; However, they can also bring over-
involvement, maternal smothering, and/or oppressive care. All in all, the Earth element brings 
nurturing and a satisfied mind. The element of Water  represents your biologi cal offspring as well 
as your ideas (your brainchildren). Both yang and yin Water years (2002, 2003, 2012, 2013) will allow optimum creativity and e xpression. The element of Wood re presents your finances. This 
element also represents your father, symbo lizing financial support to the family. Yang Wood 
years (2004, 2014) bring unexpected or sudden wealth, while yin Wood years (2005, 2015) bring 
earned or expected wealth. The element of Fire represents your career or vocation. This is a 
difficult element for you as it conflicts with your Metal daymaster. Yang Fire years (2006, 2016) 
bring difficult or unfavorable change, while yin Fire years (2007, 2017) bring beneficial change. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Rat, you are very success-oriented, with strong monetary instincts and the ability to save for a rainy day. You are an emotional but sh rewd socialite who knows 
how to use the system to get ahead. You can also be adamant and even rigid in expressing your opinions, argumentative when provoked, and quick -witted. Your sharp tongue, backed by an 
impressive vocabulary, is capable of  winning any verbal disagreement. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Tiger, you have  much ambition and are fascinating to those 
around you. Glamorous and distinctive in appearan ce, magnetism is your specialty and you stand 
out in any crowd. Although your goals may change from time to time, the Metal element bestows 
perseverance and structure. Unbending and bold in expression, you must learn to compromise 
with those who are in a position to  benefit you in or der to succeed. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Dragon, you are sh arp-tongued, argumentativ e, and a naturalborn 
performer. Capable, cunning, and particularly shrewd in business matters, you have excellent 
financial sense. You are attracted to spiritual pursuits and may choose to isolate yourself for periods of solitary contemplation. You are an en ergetic and decisive in dividual who excels at 
instructing others, facing confrontation, and handling conflicts. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Horse, you are impartial, honest, and an ardent idealist. 
Humanitarian in nature, with very high standa rds for both yourself and others, you act quickly 
and decisively. You will readily take on a cr usade or worthy cause. With your magnetic 
personality, you can go far with career ambitions. E ffective, decisive, and an expert in your field 
of interest, you are the dynamic cutting blade of the Horse family. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Monkey, you will strive for high positions. You are gifted in 
putting plans into action, and will usually be invo lved with the nuts and bolts of putting an idea 
together. Independent, solitary, and smart, you may become frustrated by failure and can be 
impatient with your life progress. Boredom is  your greatest enemy, whereas your ability to 
manipulate ideas and language is your greatest ally. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Dog, you are a paradox:  an idealistic realist who is torn between a 
desire for material success on one hand, and an e qually strong desire for spiritual reflection on 
the other. If there is a chink in someone's armor or a flaw in someone or something, you will spot 
it immediately. An independent thinker who fo llows your own path, you are success-oriented 
and steady in your determination to succeed. Your  happiness is to be found in harmonizing the 
two sides of yourself 
 
You are yin Metal Xin if your daymaster is th e Metal Ox, Metal Rabbit,  Metal Snake, Metal 
Goat, Metal Rooster, or the Metal Pig. Yin Me tal is symbolized by fine jewelry, gold, silver, 
clasps, needles, rings, and bracele ts. Xin Metal people enjoy praise , so much so that they are 
easy targets for flattery. They have an acerbic tongue  that can be as sharp as a needle and cut like 
a knife. Xin Metals make formidable enemies, have excellent memories, and can hold a grudge 
for a surprisingly long time. Despite a brusque ex terior, those with a Xi n Metal daymaster are 
very sensitive, in t ouch with their feelings, and true to themselves. They become moody, 
withdrawn, and critical if  they are overloaded with stress. Th ey have no tolerance for fools, and 
an even lower tolerance for laziness. They n eed an intellectual equa l and place a high value on 
those with whom they are mentally in synch. Xin Metals make good managers and compelling 
teachers. They are good at spotting details that others have missed. Xin Metals enjoy problem-
solving and need to be intell ectually challenged. They  are also always up for a good debate or 
discussion; they need a partner with whom they can converse and banter ideas freely. A silent, 
withdrawn, or taciturn pa rtner will result in boredom and disinterest. The Xin Metal woman can be a challenge to hand le. "Ice princess," "disda inful," and "arrogant" 
are some of the terms that come to mind. She de mands intellectual stimulat ion and places a high 
premium on a partner being her equa l, if not better than herself She needs to respect her partner 
and will not compromise on this matter. The Xin Metal woman can drink, play poker, and recite 
off-color jokes with the best of them, all while managing to present an image of propriety and 
purity. A "proper" romance is inte gral to succeeding with a Xin Metal woman-wine and dine her, 
put a little glamour and showmanship in your wooing technique, display some intelligence in 
your romantic strategy, and, most importantly, be an old-fashione d gentleman. If you get all this 
together, she may consent to come down from he r pedestal. Until then, don't waste your time. If 
you should cross the Xin Metal woman, be prepared for World War III. She is a first-rate plotter 
and schemer who serves her revenge cold. 
The Xin Metal man is energetic, competitive, am bitious, and driven. He learns quickly, has fast 
reflexes, and his principles are based on his pref erences. Personal benefits take precedence over 
any benefits to others. He usually has a hero complex, so whatever you do, play the damsel in 
distress and make him feel as though he is your rescuer. Intere stingly, the Xin Metal Man has a 
distinct feminine side and forms close friendships with women. He is also most likely very close 
with his mother and female relatives. He is fu ssy about small things, has many opinions, and is 
usually effusive and talkative.  Nuance, subtlety, and good taste are extremely important to the 
Xin Metal man, and he loathes pretentious, fake, or affected people. The Xin Metal man likes to 
be intellectually challenged and enjoys a good debate. A distant or retiring woman really doesn't 
cut it with a Xin Metal male. But remember, Mr. Xin Metal hates to be wrong, so challenge, 
excite, and debate with him, but never belittle h im. In the end, make him feel as though he comes 
out on top.

O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windfall element is yin Wood (Yi).

face of hardships, drawbacks, or initial failure s. Some may think you rigid and even severe at 
times. You are ambitious, success-oriented, and unwavering in your determination. This strong

a love and appreciation for literature and the fine arts, and especially music. 
If your daymaster is the Metal Goat, you are a curious mixture of compromise and stubbornness, 
dependence, and self-sufficency. This duality may s een like an inconsistency to others. You hide 
the heart of a warrior beneath an easygoing, ar tistic exterior. The Meta l Goat as daymaster 
reveals an energetic and shrewd individual who is  not as harmless as he or she looks. You stand 
a good chance of becoming financially fortunate , and may receive a sudden windfall or 
inheritance at some point in your life. If your daymaster is the Metal Rooster, you are pow erfully candid, have a gift for captivating an 
audience, and have been blessed with shrewd and sharp powers of deduc tion. Analytical and a 
hard worker, you may find it difficult to comp romise. Although you can feel unappreciated at 
times, nothing could be further from the truth, as your family, friends, and colleagues rely on 
your powers of observation and resourcefulness. If your daymaster is the Metal Pig, you are truly one  of the kindest and most decent people alive. 
You are pragmatic and prefer a pr edictable "sure thing" over risky ventures. Able to completely 
scrutinize a situation or troubles hoot a problem with your analytical  eye, you enjoy success, but 
remain realistic in your expect ations. You may be perceived as rigid because you can throw 
away a good situation when it does not conform to your expectations. The Water element parallels the season of wint er and represents nighttime, the Northern

The Water element represents the final period in  the 60-year cycle between the ages of 48 and 
60, a time characterized by reflection, sensitivity, and persuasiveness. Water's nature is similar to 
feelings and emotions; it descends, seeks out, and fills low places, especially the hearts of the 
downtrodden and the needy. Those with a Water da ymaster are guided by their feelings and a 
need to communicate. It endows them with a lucid and quick mind. However, Water can also be 
chaotic because it does not have its own form an d is dependent on the shape of the vessel that 
contains it. Water element people know how to persuade others and manipulate their

You are yang Water Ren if your daymaster is th e Water Rat, Water Tige r, Water Dragon, Water 
Horse, Water Monkey, or Water Dog. Yang Water is symbolized by vast ocean s, great lakes, and 
rapid rivers. Ren Water people pr efer freedom of movement and a carefree lifesty le, and strongly 
dislike pressure and confrontations. They are extroverted, optimistic, resourceful, and artistic 
lovers of poetry and dance. They also make ex cellent businesspeople. Like a rushing river, Ren 
Waters are frequently on the go. Movement and activity are important for their emotional and 
physical well-being. As the saying goes, still wate rs run deep, and it is sometimes difficult to 
"read" the Ren Water person. Dynamic and focused, Ren Waters can be myopic when they have 
their mind set on something or someone. Inconsistent and temperamental, their moods tend to 
swell and recede like the tide. Compassionate, at tentive, empathic, and warm, Ren Water persons 
sometimes care too much, and may suffer from giving more than they receive. These are the good Samaritans of the 10 heavenly stems. Unfo rtunately, they may become so concerned about 
advocating and spreading love and goodwill that they overlook the nuts-and-bolts practicalities 
of helping. Ren Waters almost always have good intentions; how ever, their hidden compulsion is 
neediness-a need to be needed, appreciated, a nd loved-but they often avoid recognizing those 
needs. 
The Ren Water female is a challenging to understand and to please. Demanding, sometimes 
snappish, and disdainful of weakne ss, she tends to have high expecta tions of her partner. Love is 
always confusing for the Ren Water woman. Should  she select a dominant, influential man who 
rebuffs her testy demeanor, or a romantic, sweet man who is always available and ready to carry 
out her wishes? Truthfully, she would love to have both avai lable for her, depending on her 
mood du jour. 
The Ren Water male is the classic strong, silent type. Never one for small talk or meaningless 
verbal banter, the Ren Water man says what he means and means what he says. His affections 
will be expressed in tangible ways such as gi fts or financial assist ance. Although he is not 
verbally effusive with his declarations of passi on, he is highly sentimental and will enjoy the little gestures and romantic things that you do. The Ren Water man will almost always be a 
successful businessman, manager, or entrepreneur, but  he'll probably be just as married to his job 
as he is to you. Nurture and f acilitate his career and you will endear yourself to him forever?

oppressive. The element of Earth represents your  career or vocation. This can be a difficult

as kind, compassionate, and loyal. You are an exceptionally scrupulous and virtuous individual 
whose principal quality is devotion. Occasi onally lacking self-conf idence, you are very 
emotional and need a lot of encouragement and emotional support from others to assuage your 
fears, worries, and self-doubts. 
 
You are yin Water Gui if your daymaster is th e Water Ox, Water Rabbit, Water Snake, Water 
Goat, Water Rooster, or Water Pig. Yin Water is symbolized by pools, small ponds, gentle rain, 
dew, and foggy mist. Gui Water people are upright , gentle, and kind. In a ddition to being humble 
and polite, they are also reliable , down-to-earth, disciplined, and helpful. With their strong sense 
of responsibility, Gui Waters ar e nurturing, inherently soft-hea rted, and childlike. They are 
innocent and can be naive regarding the realitie s of life despite their age. Gui Waters are 
inherently fickle, never able to stay in one place for too long and flitting from interest to interest. 
This daymaster reveals the heart of a paci fist; accepting, patient, unpretentious, open, and a 
genuinely nice person. The risk with Gui Waters is that they may beco me too submissive or accommodating to otherssometimes to their own detr iment. Gaining peace at any price and a fear 
of conflict prevents you from sp eaking up for yourself at times. 
Gui Water females can be temperamental. In a rela tionship, they look to th eir partner to provide 
them with clarity and confidence. The Gui Water woman has trouble making up her mind and 
will look to her partner for relationship decisions. He r interests are as changeable and fluid as her 
element; today's fancy may or may not be tomorrow's passion. The Gui Water woman needs a 
career with a lot of diversity. A job that requires  travel would suit her well. 
The Gui Water male has a reputation as a ladies' man. He likes to keep his options open and may 
string along several women at one time. He thoroughly enjoys an abundance of female attention. 
He may be loathe to settle down and become a confirmed bachelor, or a perpetual adolescent 
who endlessly plays the romantic field. With his hand on the pulse of society, he may have 
intuition and psychic powers that  are not readily apparent. His ev er-changing interests (which he 
will expect you to wholeheartedly support) are varied and unconventional at times. 
If you are yin Water Gui: 
O Your sudden, unexpected wealth/windf all element is yin Fire (Ding). 
O Your entitled, earned wealth/prope rty element is yang Fire (Bing). 
O Your happiness/guardian/proper ca re element is yang Metal (Geng). 
O Your beneficial/positive change/angel element is yang Earth (Wu). O Your unfavorable/conflic t/unbecoming/harmful elemen t is yin Earth (Ji). 
Because your daymaster element is yin Water (Gui),  the element of Water represents you as well 
as your companions, spouse, and any rivals  you might have. The Water element endows you 
with communication skills and makes for a deep a nd intuitive personality. The yearning to travel 
and to explore may be strong, too. Yang Water element years (2002, 2012) bring competitors and 
rivals, while yin Water years (2003, 2013) bring companions, helpers, and cooperative 
associations. The element of Wood represents your offspring as well as your ideas (your 
brainchildren). Water is the "parent" element that produces Wood, so both yang and yin Wood 
years (2004, 2005, 2014, 2015) will facilitate your optimum creativity and expressivity. The 
element of Fire represents your finances as well as your father. Ya ng Fire years (2006, 2016) 
bring good luck with earned wealth, and yin Fire years (2007, 2017) bring a windfall of 
unexpected or sudden wealth. The element of Meta l is favorable and represents your Mother. It 
also represents all caretakers, mentors, a nd persons who support or protect you. All things 
connected to the Metal element will be lucky and bring happiness to you. Both yin and yang 
Metal years (2001, 2002, 2011, 2012) bring nurturing and pr oper guidance, as Metal is the parent 
element to your Water daymaster. The element of Earth represents your ca reer or vocation. This 
is a difficult element for you, as the Earth "traps" and controls your Water daymaster. Yin Earth 
years (2009, 2019) can bring unfavorable or di scordant change, but yang Earth years (2008, 
2018) bring beneficial, albe it uncomfortable, change. If your daymaster is the Water Ox, you have a way with words and a talent for achieving goals in 
an indirect way. With your knack for accurately  gauging future outcomes and using the talents 
and resources of others, you are persuasive and able to wear away even the most resistant 
detractor with your quiet yet cons tant efforts. You are intuitiv e and stealthy, and prefer to 
infiltrate rather than dominate. 
If your daymaster is the Water Rabbit, you are a deep thinker and possesses enhanced intuition 
bordering on the psychic. Sensitive and well-lik ed, your vulnerable feelings can be soothed by 
liberal doses of luxury and the finer things in life. You are also a gifted judge of character. You 
value sincerity and despise deception, and are eagerly sought out for your good taste and advice. 
If your daymaster is the Water Snake, you are obj ective, compassionate, a nd an excellent student 
of human nature. You are charismatic, capable, and insightful, possessing an intuitive radar. A 
natural-born empathy, you have a well-devel oped capacity for fee ling the pain of and 
empathizing with others. You enjoy a multitude of interests and have friends from very diverse 
backgrounds. 
If your daymaster is the Water Goat, you ar e a peace-loving artist and creative savant. 
Humanitarian yet shrewd to the ways of the world, you possess remarkable street-smarts. You 
need a healthy amount of emotional support; in f act, dependence on others is a definite risk you 
run with this daymaster. You may be a poet, wr iter, artist, or performe r. Seductiveness is your 
forte, but unfortunately, patience is not. 
If your daymaster is the Water Rooster, you are fond of social activity and never hesitate to share 
your opinions with others. Candid, outspoken, and resourceful, you are energetic and possess a 
sarcastic yet enjoyable sense of humor. You enjo y the arts and anything recreational (the more 
people present the better). Profic ient in the use of the written word and a commanding speaker, 
you possess a strong personality and will always find a more efficient way to complete any task. 
If your daymaster is the Water Pig, competition is of  little interest to you; what you seek is peace 
and tranquility. You are shy and quiet, yet able  to express yourself eloquently. Hardworking, 
longsuffering, and loyal, you may have felt constr ained somehow during your early life. You are 
a very private person, and have a horror of airi ng your dirty laundry in public. Sweet, gentle, and 
pure of heart, you prefer to live within a safe  and comfortable world of love and affection. 
  
 
  
The fourth and last pillar of destiny is the hour pillar. Similar to the year, month, and day pillars, 
the hour pillar is composed of tw o Chinese characters that depict the cosmic qi distinct to the 
time you were born. Each year, month, day, and hour has its own energy. The energy, or qi, that 
surrounds you as you take your first breath is your destiny. For example, 12 noon is very 
different from 12 midnight: noon is very "yang" and full of life, whereas midnight is very "yin," 
quiet, and still. Each animal sign or branch infl uences a two-hour period of each 24-hour day. It not only modifies and shades your personality, bu t also represents your offspring, your creative 
ideas, and your career. Using the software includ ed, find your hour pillar in the center of your Zi 
Wei Dou Shu chart.

special patterns with your birth month, birth day, or birth year p illars? We'll see in the next 
chapter! 
  
 
  
When certain signs group together, they can be favorable or unfavorable. For example, a 
combination such as the Dog, Tiger, and Hors e reveals ambition and motivation, whereas the 
combination of the Ox and Goat can signal i nner struggles and conflic t. This chapter is 
concerned with the combinations that are co mpatible. Write down your Four Pillars here: 
 The Three Crosses 
The three crosses contain two se ts of opposite signs. Although an opposition between signs is 
usually unfavorable, when all four signs (two pair s of opposites) team up together in a chart, they 
become favorable in specific ways. If you have three out of the four signs in  the cross, or if two 
signs are missing, there can be problems. Do you ha ve any of these combinations in your chart? 
The peach blossoms: Rat, Rabbit, Horse, and Rooster Power and fame are indicated here. This group signifies balance through tension. Because all 
four of these signs are peach blossoms, you are at extremely high risk for all kinds of vices, from 
gambling to obsessive love. This combination can thrust you to the top of love's mountain or slay 
you in the valley of heartbreak. These four signs found together in a chart bring with them torrid 
love affairs and unforgettable ro mances. For example, the chart of a beautiful ex-model turned 
local entertainer on her fifth marriage, born June  15, 1945 at 12:09 a.m. local time, with all four 
peach blossoms in her chart, shows that she pr obably struggles with relationships and various 
addictions.: 
 
 
If one sign is missing from these four, this can cause problems, as well: 0 If Rat is absent, you have trouble keepi ng track of money and may spend impulsively. 
O If Rabbit is absent, you have probl ems with health, home, or children. 
O If Horse is absent, you have problems with  mobility, movement, and physical weakness. 
O If Rooster is absent, you suffer from unwa rranted anxiety and an inability to relax. 
The literary cross: Ox, Dragon, Goat, Dog 
Literary and artistic potential and endeavors are indicated here. Some of the great masters of 
music had these four signs in thei r chart. For example, the chart of a composer and multitalented 
musician born on April 8, 1973 at 2:17 p.m. local time shows all four literary signs: 
 
 
Do you have one sign that is missing from these four? O If Ox is absent, you lack perseverance or stamina. 
O If Dragon is absent, you are hesitant to try new things. O If Goat is absent, you lack family ties and/or contacts. 
O If Dog is absent, you have di fficulty adjusting or adapting. 
The four steeds: Tiger, Snake, Monkey, Pig 
Also known as the four winged horses, these are the energies of movement, change, travel, and 
reevaluation. This movement can either be by choice (to walk in) or by force (to be pulled 
in).Travel and immigration are indicated. This group signifies continuous journeys and perhaps 
even a nomadic life. Having all four steed signs  in a chart can be exhausting, draining, and 
depleting. For example, a computer specialis t who travels all over the country on work 
assignments, born September 5, 1959 at 10:34am local time, shows all four steed in her chart: 
 
 
Do you have one sign that is missing from these four?

Compatible Combinations 
In-kind 
"In-kind" combinations are two si gns in sequence which team up to  complete one of the six life 
palaces. Each sign is coupled together with the sign found directly before or after it. The six in-
kind palaces are: 
 
1. Rat/Ox-creative expression 
2. Tiger/Rabbit-progress/success 
3. Dragon/Snake-spirituality 
4. Horse/Goat-sexuality/reproduction 5. Monkey/Rooster-career/vocation 
6. Dog/Pig-home and hearth Palace #1 creative expression-Ra t (begins)/Ox (completes): 
The Rat and Ox make up the life palace of crea tivity and artistic expression. When the Rat and 
Ox are found together in a chart,  it reveals an extremely creativ e individual. It also shows a 
person who is family-oriented and wishes to cr eate a kind of personal sanctuary around himor 
herself 
Palace #2 progress/success-Tiger (force)/Rabbit (persuasion): 
Part boisterous Tiger, part understated Rabbit, if these two signs are found together in your chart, 
they will greatly assist you in developing and fostering your personal talents. The Rabbit 
accomplishes by diplomacy and the Tiger develops by force. 
Palace #3 spirituality-Dragon (magician)/Snake (sage): 
The magical Dragon and the mystical Snake make up the life palace of sp irituality. If these two 
signs are found together in your chart, you will ha ve a deep, otherworldly side. The possessive 
Snake and autonomous Dragon allow you to rise a bove the mundane and soar to new esoteric 
heights. 
Palace #4 sexuality/reproduction-Horse (ya ng masculine)/Goat (yin feminine): 
The Horse and the Goat comprise the life palace of sexuality. These two form opposite sides of 
the same coin and make for a powerfully magneti c and sensual personality . If these signs are 
found together in your chart, you will have a perfect balance of male, yang force and female, yin 
force, thus attracting many admirers. 
Palace #5 Career/vocation-Monkey (ver satility)/Rooste r (efficiency): 
The Monkey and Rooster comprise the life pa lace of career and vocat ion. These two signs 
together in a chart reveal cleverness, dexterity, and a shrewd, qui ck wit. The Rooster promotes 
you via competence, and the Monkey, via craftiness.  This pairing in a ch art brings success in 
business. Palace #6 home and hearth-Dog (creates)/Pig (finishes): 
When the earnest Dog and affectionate Pig are found teamed up in a chart, one will find a lover 
of home and family. Together they reveal a loya l and romantic individual whose allegiance is to 
his or her family, spouse, and/or children. 
Trine signs These four groups form very favorable combinations in a chart. They are: the pillars of creativity 
(Rat/Dragon/ Monkey); the pillar s of trade and commerce (Ox/Sn ake/Rooster); the pillars of 
ambition (Tiger/Dog/Horse); and the pillars of home and family  (Rabbit/Goat/Pig). The pillars of creativity-concealment, unpredictability, irrepressibility: 
If you have a Rat, Dragon, and Monkey combina tion present, you could well be an inventive 
genius, able to make your ideas work and bring drawing-board concepts into tangible reality. 
Ideas become possibilities, whic h are then transformed into actuality. This combination makes 
for an intense and enthusiastic personality. You will tend toward restlessness and will definitely 
accomplish what you set out to do. Impetuous and easily frustrated, you possess a triple dose of 
potent, positive, masculine yang energy. 
 
The pillars of trade and commerce-en durance, accumulation, application: 
If you have an Ox, Snake, and Rooster combination present, you have a natural business sense 
and the ability to persevere until the end. You could become extremely wealthy as a result of your business savvy and consistent staying power. This combination also makes for a fixed and 
rigid personality with strong opinions and views.  You will be a genius at meticulous planning, 
and understand the wisdom of deferred gratifi cation. Stable and longlasting, you are ruled by 
deep, dark, negative, feminine yin energy. 
 The pillars of ambition-decisi veness, nobility, watchfulness: 
If you have a Tiger, Horse, and Dog combination present, you are a highly motivated go-getter, 
most likely an entrepreneur of some type. You ar e active and determined to succeed at any price, 
and will aim for the top in your chosen field. This combination of signs in a chart also reveals a 
humanitarian who excels in verbal communication and is a gifted speaker. Relationships and personal connections are your highest priority; yo u seek a soulmate in this life. Idealistic, 
influential, and upright, you are ruled by potent, positive, masculine yang energy. 
 
The pillars of home and family-det achment, propriety, resignation: 
If you have a Rabbit, Goat, and Pig combination present, you are destin ed to live a happy and 
contented life. A fruitful career and cozy home are just some of the rewards with this peaceful, 
empathic, and lucky combination. Family will al ways come first for you. This combination of 
signs in a chart reveals a quest fo r all things spiritual and beautiful  in this life. You are artistic, 
refined, and well-mannered. You also possess a more placid temperament than others, and recoil 
from strife and ugliness. Reflective and gentle, you are ruled by deep, dar k, negative, submissive, 
feminine yin energy. 
 Best Sign Combinations 
Powerful, strong, and very harmonious, these six si gn combinations are the luckiest of the lucky 
to find in your chart. They are: Rat/Ox, Pig/Tiger, Dog/Rabbit, Rooster/Dragon, Monkey/ Snake, 
and Goat/Horse. 
 
Rat/Ox: 
The combination of these compatible signs in  a chart is very luc ky and produces a very 
sentimental and vulnerable person. These two signs form the foundation for a family- and 
securityoriented life. The Ox provides you with stability, consistency, a nd practicality, while the 
Rat bestows clever ideas and the ability to ex hibit these ideas by wa y of tangible projects. 
Pig/Tiger: 
The combination of these compatible signs in a ch art is very lucky and pr oduces an affectionate, 
forthright person. These two signs form th e foundation for a life filled with grand 
accomplishments and success in friendships and in love. The Tiger provides you with the ability to work through nearly any difficulty, and the Pig imparts a great need for affection and physical 
comforts. 
Dog/Rabbit: The combination of these compatible signs in a chart is very lucky. It produces a tenderhearted 
person who will have the well-being and personal growth of others in the forefront of his or her heart and mind. You are a selfless type of person who gives the best of yourself to others and 
will make many personal connections in this lif etime. The devoted Dog makes you watchful, and 
the detached Rabbit reveals your faithfulness as a friend. 
Rooster/Dragon: 
The combination of these compatible signs in a chart is very lucky and produces an independent 
person who will always retain his or her own outside interests.  The Rooster provides you with 
spunk and enterprise, and the Dragon bestows drama a nd the ability to hold th e interest of others. 
You could be very successful on the stage or pod ium, and will be eye-catching in any type of 
uniform or costume. 
Monkey/Snake: The combination of these compatible signs in a chart is very lucky and produces an intense, 
physically attractive individual w ho has an equal measure of bot h guile and allure. The Snake 
provides you with a deep philosophical side, whil e the Monkey gives you the ability to transform 
raw materials into something beautiful. You coul d be very successful in any kind of career that 
requires you to be convi ncing, such as sales. 
Goat/Horse: 
The combination of these compatible signs in a chart is very lucky and produces a person who is 
both decisive and creative. These two signs form the base for a life filled with debate, oration, 
and public speaking. The Horse is the personifica tion of the yang, masculine day-force, and the 
Goat is the very essence of the yin, feminine night -force. If these two signs  connect in your chart, 
you could be very successful in any career th at concerns human sexuality or reproduction. 
Multiple Signs 
If your chart contains two, three, or all four of its  pillars in the same branch animal sign, the traits 
of the sign are enhanced even further. For ex ample, a firefighter born on October 31, 1958, at 
7:30 p.m. local time, shows a triple Dog pillar: 
 
And an extraordinarily beautiful young fash ion designer born on May 19, 1989, at 9:15 a.m. 
local time, shows a triple Snake pillar:  
In the chart that follows, you can mix and match th e animal branches in your four pillars chart 
and evaluate the degree of compatibility between pillars. 
In the next chapter, we will explore the more di fficult or clashing combinations between pillars, 
squares, oppositions, and other combatant combinations. 
  
 
  
Oppositional combinations involve signs that are lo cked in combat with one another. These are 
the worst-of-the-worst combinations that cause frustrations, delays, and other difficulties. 
Sometimes these difficult sign combinations are placed in our charts for a reason-for personal growth, for example. Combatant signs paired toge ther in a combatant vi bration will exhibit the 
darker side of the sign's nature. We can choose to conquer the conflict onc e and for all or deal with it at another time. The type  of difficulty and obstacle can be  determined by the qualities of 
the signs themselves and the life pillars where they are found. 
 
Pillars of Conflict 
Rat/Goat: 
These two signs found together in  your chart indicate difficultie s. Hyperactivity fights against 
sloth, and the results can be inharmonious to sa y the least. Part of you is a thrifty, neat 
perfectionist, while the other half is a messy sp endthrift with a penchant for shopping. You may 
fluctuate between interests and can view your world in radically diffe rent ways depending on 
your mood. Someone with a conflicted Rat in his or her chart can be covert and secretive, and 
will deflect or mislead if it is to his/her advant age. He or she may also be difficult to please, 
demanding, and highly critical of ot hers. Someone with a conflicted Goat in his or her chart can 
be irresponsible, undisciplined, and unreliable. He/she could eas ily squander a small fortune or 
run up astronomical bills. He/she may complain bitterly when matters don't go his or her way. 
Ox/Horse: When these two signs are found together in your  chart, idealism meets dispassion and neither 
part of you can easily reconcile with the other. Pa rt of you feels a duty to the family circle, while 
the other part wishes to escap e all confinements a nd responsibilities. You experience conflicts 
over choices between home and hearth on one ha nd, and outside activities on the other. Someone 
with a conflicted Ox can be overly stern and di splay a terrible temper. He or she hates to be 
contradicted, especially in front of others, and can be subject to  explosive outbreaks of anger. 
He/she does not enjoy being teased and can hold grudges for a long ti me. Someone with a 
conflicted Horse can be infatuate, hotheaded, and incredibly selfish. He/she may be tactless and 
ruthless, and believe that this world a nd everything in it belongs to him/her. 
Tiger/Snake: 
When these two signs are found together in your ch art, impatience meets reserve, and fast butts 
heads with slow. Part of you always feels pushe d to go faster than you are comfortable with. 
Conflicts occur internally between waiting and acting. One facet of you is externally focused 
while the other remains inte rnally centered. Endless pondering can cause you to miss 
opportunities. Someone with a conf licted Tiger is careless, obs tinate, and rebellious. His/her 
pride gets him/her in trouble frequently. He/she  is reckless and oppositional, and tends to make 
foolish or hasty decisions. Someone with a confli cted Snake can be overly covert and secretive, 
and vacillate between being extrav agant and stingy. He/she is lik ely possessive and jealous, yet a 
shameless philanderer and hedonist. Laziness and procrastination are some of this person's most 
irritating personality traits. 
Rabbit/Dragon: 
When these two signs are found together in your  chart, good manners meet  boorishness. Part of 
you is refined and mannerly, while the other side is crass and outspoken. This can cause you 
embarrassment and create many tensions in your re lationships. You experience difficulties with 
friendships, family relations, a nd especially lovers. Someone with a conflicted Rabbit can be 
overly aloof, secretive, and petty. He or she may run away when being forced to choose sides or 
make difficult choices. He/she is likely co mmitment-phobic, and ma y relish the role of 
philanderer. Someone with a conflicted Dragon can be short-tempered, demanding, and cruelly 
candid. A soul of extremes, he/she channels intense energy negatively, which can cause great 
destruction. The tendency to be  unfaithful is one of his/he r most unattractive traits. 
Monkey/Pig: 
When these two signs are found together in your ch art, the trickster meets the naive, and the con 
man combines with the duped victim. This combina tion creates a great deal of conflict within the 
conscience. One side of you wants to be truthful and forthright, while the other part can't help 
pulling the wool over people's eyes. Someone w ith a conflicted Monkey is manipulative, 
opportunistic, and status-seeking. He/she hides a low opinion of  others behind an outward 
friendliness. He/she has a complicated and dubi ous personality which, when skewed, becomes 
trickery, arrogance, and self-inter est. Someone with a conflicted Pig is passive, self-indulgent, 
and uncompetitive. He/she has a passive-aggressive  personality and can use it as an excuse to avoid making decisions. His/her s earch for earthly pleasures can blind him/her and lead him/her 
down a carnal path to fetishes and perversions of all types. 
Dog/Rooster: 
This is an especially antagonistic combination. When these two signs are found together in your 
chart, egotism combines with insecurity. One si de of you is thin-skinned to criticism, and the 
other is the instigator of such criticism (usually in the form of some pretty caustic verbal barbs). 
You will have your feelings hurt frequently because you can dish out critique better than you can 
take it. Someone with a conflicted Dog is agit ated, secretive, and paranoid. Conflicted Dog 
pillars can reveal a "prophet of doom" ment ality; many times these individuals are 
condescending and moralistic. They are also pron e to obsessive, dysfuncti onal relationships with 
troubled partners. Someone with a conflicted Rooste r is vain, hairsplitting,  and downright cruel. 
He/she may have a sadistic streak and suffer fr om vanity and obsession with his/her appearance. 
He/she may also tend to focus on perfec tion and be highly cr itical of others. 
Pillars of Opposition 
These signs are in direct oppositio n and repel each other due to cl ashes in essential qi. The six 
oppositions are: Rat/ Horse, Ox/Goat, Tiger/Monk ey, Rabbit/ Rooster, Dragon/Dog, Snake/Pig. 
Rat/Horse: 
When both of these opposite signs are found together  in your chart, it poin ts to tensions. A dual 
nature means that you have a need for security  along with a conflicting need for independence. 
Love relationships are tumultuous; initially they seem to be made in heaven, but can end in 
disappointment and bitterness.  
Ox/Goat: 
When both of these opposite signs are found together  in your chart, it poin ts to tensions. These 
two signs are polarized opposites with radically different temperaments and opinions. Having 
both present in your chart can make you feel as  though you are in a mental prison of sorts. 
Artistic and laid-back Goats thrive in a cas ual atmosphere, whereas Oxen are regulated, 
organized, and controlled. The Ox side of your  personality continually fights with the 
unpredictable, capricious Goat. Th e pillar that is involved will determine the life area or phase 
that will be most affected by this combination. Tiger/Monkey: 
There will be trust issues in some form when  the Tiger and Monkey comprise two of your four 
pillars. Depending on which pillars  are affected, you mistrust others, but are capable of playing 
tricks and conning others. The tug-of war between ethics and desires can wreck havoc on your 
personality. A know-it-a ll attitude contribute d by the Monkey, combined with the Tiger's 
bravado to express it readily, te nds to provoke other people. If these two signs are placed in your 
day and hour pillars, antagonism in your marriage or primary relationship and between you and your children may plague you. This combination of signs almost always reveals an extremely independent person who opts to spend a lot of time away from their home base. Constant change, 
travel, and danger are in stor e for you throughout your life. 
Rabbit/Rooster: 
These two oppositions are also peach blossoms or love signs. When found together in a chart, 
they can indicate problems and conflicts in romantic relationships. Compatibility with another 
person may always seem just out of your reach. Th e Rooster's aggressive verbal style mixed with 
the sensitive Rabbit's feelings produces an indivi dual who can dish out cr iticism, but has trouble 
taking it. This very inauspicious combination of opposite signs reveals an individual who is 
cocky and self-assured one minute, and aloof and withdrawn the next. You likely have a virtuous 
moral character, yet progress is limited due to your self-punishing and constraining personality. 
Best results can be achieved by commandeering the Rooster's resourcef ulness and the Rabbit's 
creativity in order to find temperance in a pe rsonality that gravitates toward extremes. 
Dragon/Dog: 
When both of these opposite signs are found togeth er in your chart, it po ints to bitterness, 
antagonism, and great stress. Th is case of two polarized opposites clashing produces an 
individual who is brutally honest and candid to a fault. Love relations hips are particularly 
affected, with many bumps, dramas, traumas, and sticky situations along th e way. As it is in the 
Rooster/Rabbit combination, the outspoken Dragon aspect criticizes with impunity, but has 
trouble accepting the same criticism due to the hypersensitive Dog side of the personality. This is 
not someone you should ever deliber ately anger or engage with in  a verbal sparring match. The 
greatest hurdle to jump for this individual will be  to quell the conflict th at rages between a sense 
of duty on one hand, and indifference on the other.  If this is your combination, you need to 
remember that being involved doesn't necessarily  mean that you are solely responsible for the 
outcome. 
Snake/Pig: With this combination, the childlike honesty of the Pig clashes rather abr uptly with the elastic 
conscience of the Snake. Although both sides of the personality are generally agreeable and 
deeply feeling, the Snake's dishonesty and opportuni sm clashes with the honest Pig. In addition, 
the Snake's penchant for penny-pinching causes great stress for the self-indul gent Pig side of the 
personality. One part of the person scrimps a nd saves, only to go on an extravagant shopping 
binge a week later. This person's taste for l uxury may be extreme, and over-indulgence in 
material pleasures is almost assured. 
Pillars of Arguing, Fighting, and Penalties 
Finding pillars doubled up, side-by-si de, or in any combination of these four signs can presage 
serious maladjustment problems. 
O Two Horses yields sharply defined gender roles and an extreme personality. O Two Roosters is a warning sign to avoid dependence on alcohol or drugs. 
O Two Pigs yields a person who is selfish, partisan, and judgmental. 
O Two Dragons betokens personal rivalries, as well as an overconfident, rash, and antagonistic 
personality. 
Here is an example of a difficult and conflic ted chart for a yin female born on December 15, 
1967, at 2:30 a.m. local time: 
 
Not only are there multiple sign clashes and oppositions present, but the elements in the chart are 
fighting one another. Not surprisingly, this lady is not a happy camper. Her list of life crises 
would take pages to chronicle. Domestic violence, parental a lienation, trouble with the law, 
relationship problems/divorce, and chronic health problems lead th e list. Her birth year pillar 
(self) of the Fire Goat is fighti ng the element of the Water Ox in her day pillar (marriage, spouse) 
and month pillar (parents). The branch animal si gn of her Goat year is in opposition to her day 
pillar and hour pillar (both Ox en), as well. This reveals opposi tions with spouse and offspring, 
but even more severe conflicts during childhood with her parents. In fact, she was a rebellious 
runaway teen who balked against her parents' rule s and control. In addition, the Water element is 
too heavy in her chart, indicating emotional issues and imbalan ces such as depression, mania, 
anxieties, and phobias. This imbalance of the Water el ement is also the source of her desire to be 
free of commitments, obligations to, and dependence on other people. 
However, the grass is a little gr eener on the other side of her chart. Looking for balance and what 
is positive in a chart, even when it looks bleak, is important. Although this person has had 
difficulty adjusting and will likely continue to  have difficult relationships, her parents, her 
spouse(s), and her offspring will experience harmony amongst themselves. The Rat in her 
parents pillar and the Ox in both her day a nd hour pillars reveal good rapport between her 
parents and offspring, as well as between her pare nts and her spouse. Her children and her ex do, 
in fact, have a favorable connection. 
  
 
  
In Chapter 4, we discovered the daymaster and the significance of the element of your day of 
birth. Elements that create, produce, and support your daymaster element are considered lucky. 
Here are some examples: 
O If your daymaster element is Wood, Fire a nd Water are usually ausp icious; Metal is not. O If your daymaster element is Fire, Wood and Earth are usually auspicious; Water is not. 
O If your daymaster element is Earth, Metal an d Fire are usually au spicious; Wood is not. 
O If your daymaster element is Metal, Water and Earth are usually ausp icious; Fire is not. 
O If your daymaster element is Water, Metal and Wood are usually ausp icious; Earth is not. 
Another way of determining your lucky and unl ucky elements is to add up the elemental 
"weights," or scores, in your birth chart. The el ements with the lowest score or weight will be 
your lucky ones. To do this, give yourself 100 points for each element you find in your four 
pillars. In addition, each of the 12 animal signs has a main element and hidden elements. For the 
sake of simplicity, we will only use the main el ement of each sign: Rat = Water, Ox = Earth, 
Tiger = Wood, Rabbit = Wood, Dragon = Earth, Sn ake = Fire, Horse = Fire, Goat = Earth, 
Monkey = Metal, Rooster = Metal, Dog = Earth, and Pig = Water. For the following chart with a 
Water Ox daymaster, we would calcu late the elemental weights thusly: 
 
Water: 100 X 3 for the top stems, and 100 for the Rat branch = 400 
In this instance, Wood and Metal are the lucky elements. Adding them to this person's life and 
environment will be most auspicious. Water and Earth are too heavy in this chart and, therefore, 
unlucky, so minimizing them will be beneficial.

There is a great disparity between  Eastern and Western cultures in how our earthly existence is 
viewed. Traditionally, Westerners do not believe that  fate and luck can be pre-determined. It is 
widely believed that achievement is by choice, fortitude, and diligence, and that even those from 
meager beginnings can rise to the highest pi nnacles. The idea of set limitations or a 
predetermined fate is frowned upon or labeled as superstition. However, consider how many 
intelligent people you have known who, despite their education, talents, and countless opportunities, never rise above a certain level. Conversely, think of all the rather dull, lazy, 
and/or painfully incompetent people who always ha ppen to be in the right place at the right time, 
and who catapult to the top, seemingly without effort. 
For the ancient Chinese, fate, or ming shu, was a reality. They believed that each of us is born 
with our own abilities and limita tions, and it is by ac knowledging and accepting these limitations 
that we can walk upon a life path leading to success rather than to frustration. They also believed 
that our fate is determined at birth. Our xian tia n, or inherent temperamen t, is set and cannot be 
changed. It is what we start out with in life, our natural endowment, so to speak. The birth chart is akin to a schematic or owner's manual for an  intricate machine. Your  personal specifications, 
model number, operating instructions, and potential hazards are just some of the enlightenments 
included. The manufacturer has designed our "defau lt" specifications, such as our birth date and 
time, our parents, our siblings, our ethnicit y, and so on. These are all fixed and cannot be 
changed. 
However, there are aspects of your life that can  be changed through luck, or yun. Yun is that 
which we have control over through our efforts a nd character. In the West, luck is similar to 
chance in that it is random and can only be unde rstood or manipulated by  using statistics and 
probability. Therefore, if luck is  random, it is also unpredictable.  The Chinese concept of luck, 
however, is different in that it is cyclical and predictable. In this respect, it is similar to the orbits 
of the planets. An orbit is not a random movement, but passes through space and time in a 
specific predictable pattern. This makes it knowable. Likewise, if we know the status of our luck 
at any particular time, we can base our actions and our choices on how strong or weak it is. Understanding our strong points, our weaknesses, our  potential, and our limitations is a move in 
an empowering direction. The art of fortune-tellin g originated from the desire to understand an 
unknowable world. It allowed the ancients to gain a semblance of control over seemingly haphazard natural occurrences. It is no wonder that  the art of divination has become an integral 
part of the Chinese culture. 
Over many millennia, the Chinese people created, documented, and correlated five major arts 
and philosophies. To understand the Zi Wei D ou Shu chart, you must begin by understanding 
and distinguishing these five major arts: 
1. Shan Shu is the cultivation of  an area of interest while livin g in seclusion. Shan (literally, 
"mountain") refers to practices that were carried out traditionally in the mountains. This included 
all religious beliefs and practi ces (Buddhism, Confucianism, and Ta oism), cloistered meditation, 
and Zen. Areas of study such as qigong, martia l arts, and white tiger/jade dragon sexual 
cultivation, are included in Shan Shu. 
2. Yi Shu refers to the practice of Traditiona l Chinese Medicine (TCM), which includes 
acupuncture, reflexology, and spir itually guided life-force ener gy expressed physically. Also 
included in Yi Shu is the study a nd use of traditional Chinese herb s, tonics, and remedies. Other 
holistic practices, such as macrobiotics and the pursuit of physical longevity  are included in Yi 
Shu, as well. 3. Xiang Shu is the practice of face-reading and pa lmistry. It also includes feng shui, the Chinese 
art of placement. Feng shui (l iterally, "wind and water") is about controlling our luck by 
observing and manipulating our environment and th e objects in it, using the knowledge of yin 
and yang and the five elements. 
4. Bu Shu is the art of divination through omen s, signs, and oracles. This earliest means of 
interpreting the will of heaven was by reading cracks on animal bones or tortoise shells. It dates 
from around 2,600 BC or even earlier. The interp retations are represented by the 64 I-Ching 
hexagrams grouped into the eight sections of th e Ba Gua. The I-Ching, or Book of Changes, is 
one of the oldest of the classic Chinese texts.  Used as a system of divination by casting yarrow 
stalks or coins, the I-Ching remains the most timeless of the Bu Shu arts. 
5. Ming Shu (literally, "magical calculations") consists of the various means for predicting the 
future, most notably astrology. Ming Shu cente rs on the dynamic yin/yang balance of opposites 
and all life events (both helpful and harmful) as  a process. By analyzi ng character traits and 
potentials using the year, month, day, and time of  birth, we can predict and understand events. 
This is what Ming Shu and, really, al l forms of fortune-telling are about. 
The Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is a profound form of  Ming Shu. Although Zi Wei is the highest form 
of astrology and divination, it is an art form that anyone with dedication can master. There is a 
certain karmic element in Chinese astrology: what we are now is a result of what we were in a 
past life, and where we end up in the next life w ill be a result of what we make of this present 
life and what baggage we bring with us. That being said, success in life is, by and large, based on 
five areas of influence or importance: 
1. Ming: Our fate, which is set at birth and cannot be changed, but can be known. 2. Yun: Our luck, which is predictable, but fluctuates with time. 3. Feng shui: Our environment, which may be manipul ated to reach higher levels than what our 
fate and luck would allow. 4. Dao de: Our virtue and character, which brings good karma and goodwill. 5. Du shu: Our education and effort, the grunt work of life. 
The Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is undoubtedly the Dewey decimal system of humanity and the 
universe! We will learn this amazing system by b ecoming familiar with the Zi Wei chart and its 
life palaces in the chapters to come. 
  
  
 
The Zi Wei Dou Shu chart shows each decade of lif e in detail, as various stars move in and out 
of 12 life houses, or "palaces." Everyone is born with a certain ming (socioeconomic status) and 
a certain yun (ups and downs of life). Together, ming yun makes up each person's fate or destiny. Ming is the life overview and does not change; yun, however, fluctuates from childhood through 
old age. One of the 12 zodiac animal symbols (earth ly branches) is also assigned to each of the 
12 life palaces, and "flavors" both the decade an d that specific area of life. When these 12 
palaces are examined together with major and mi nor stars, one can discover the fate (ming yun) 
and destiny (tian ming) of one's life. 
The Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is plotted in a large re ctangle (symbolizing a rice field), and is divided 
into 12 houses or boxes (plots of land). Thes e are called the 12 life palaces, or quons. The 
destiny, or ming, palace is the most important of these 12, and is main focal point of a Zi Wei 
Dou Shu birth chart. It embodies the sum and su bstance of a person and discloses his or her 
destiny. The self, destiny, character, and one's likely fate are all found here. It divulges whether 
one's general outlook, inborn capabilities, level of achievement, and basic character will be influenced by the imperial (royal) energies, the martial (fighting) energi es, or the psycho-social 
(humanitarian) energies. It shows one's  physical characteristics, as well. 
The Life Palaces 
The parents palace reveals your parents, family background, elders, teachers, authorities, bosses, 
and clients. The energies located in this palace de scribe the social situati on of your parents, their 
luck, how well they get along, their longevity, and their relationships  with their children, if any. 
This palace also indicates th e prospect of inheritance. 
The karma palace reveals your moral, spiritual,  and emotional aspects. It tells you how happy 
you will be, your outlook on life, your biases, and your hang-ups. Next to the destiny palace, this 
is the most influential of the life palaces. It can improve a bad destiny or deteriorate a good one. 
The Karma palace also reveals your spiritual enjoyment, your peace of mind, and how well you 
enjoy life. It is a looking glass into th e soul, the emotions, and the intellect. 
The property palace reveals the wealth, property, inheritance(s), investments, and standard of 
living you will have. It also governs your living environment and home life, whether good or 
bad. 
The career or vocational palace reve als the type of career that is  most suitable for you. It also 
determines the amount of success you can expect in your chosen career. Your work environment 
is also displayed here. When this palace is stud ied in connection with the destiny palace, it can 
also indicate how you should deve lop your career, and whether you ar e suited to work for others 
or be in charge of your own business. 
The friends or peers palace reveals the kind of  peers and colleagues you will have and whether 
they will be helpful to you or not. It also represents the relationship you have with your friends. 
Staff, close friends, colleagues, and people who work with you or for you are found here. This 
palace is also an important complement to th e destiny palace. Here, you can spot whether your 
friends and colleagues are loyal or if they will betray you. The stars found placed here will 
describe your friends  or hired help. The travel or others palace reveals what kind of  traveling you will do and whether you will need 
to relocate to achieve success. Journeys, voyages, changes, and international matters are manifest 
in this life palace. This house explains your deali ngs with others and with foreign countries. It 
also shows your level of  sociability and describes your outward appearance. 
The health or physical body palace reveals your general health, the kinds  of diseases you may 
encounter, and your longevity. This palace is also concerned with your mental health, as well as 
any injuries cause d by accidents. 
The wealth or prosperity palace reveals your finances, and can predict whether you will have 
steady income or encounter losses. It also tells whether income is from hard work or from other 
sources, such as inheritance or windfall. Wealt h, luck with money, and lifetime fortune are all 
found in this life palace. This pa lace is also studied in conjuncti on with the career palace to 
determine how you should make your money, and to  find your wealth luck (strong or weak) and 
earning capacity. 
The children or minors palace reveals whether yo u will have children or not, and what your 
relationship with them will be. It also reveals subordinates, employees, and students. This palace 
is also concerned with your ideas, or brainchildren. Informa tion concerning minors, children, 
offspring, nieces, nephews, and all of your descendants will be found in this life palace. 
The spouse or marriage palace reveals the character  of your spouse and your love relationships. 
This palace can also predict whether your marriage will end in divorce, and whether there will be 
affairs. Spouses, unions, and intimate relationships  will be addressed in this palace. Your love 
affairs, married life, sexual behaviors, and the number of marriages you will most likely have can 
also be found there. The stars present in this pa lace will indicate what kind of person your spouse 
is and whether or not your marriage will be successful and happy. The siblings palace reveals th e relationship between you and your  siblings, as well as their 
respective characters. Step-siblings , business partners, and colleague s are revealed here, as well. 
This palace divulges the relationship with your siblings, your business partners, your 
schoolmates, and whether your relationships w ith these people will be helpful or not. 
We will discuss these 12 palace s and the meanings of the individual stars occupying these 
palaces in greater depth in the next chapters. 
Zi Wei Do Shu analysis shows the positions of both beneficial and detrimental stars in each 
palace to predict an individual's most likely fu ture and fate. The 12 animal signs have fixed 
positions in the chart, while the location of th e various palaces will differ based upon the birth 
information. For example, the Tiger may correspond to  the siblings palace or the wealth palace, 
depending whether the person is male or female, and yin or yang. A life palace is affected and influenced by the palaces adjacent to it, opposite it, and in one of the ha rmonious trines below it. 
The opposite palace is a mirror image of the pala ce being analyzed. These two palaces will have 
the strongest influence on each other. Interpretation begins with looking at where th e major influential star s are placed. "Trines" 
(palaces that form a triangle) are strongly conne cted and highly relevant to each other in the 
interpretation. The harmonious connected palace trines are: 
O Destiny/wealth/career palaces 
O Children/elders/friends palaces 
O Relationship/karmic luck/travel palaces O Siblings/propert y/health palaces 
The palaces directly opposite each  other are interdependent and influence each other, as well. 
These include: O The destiny and travel palaces O The siblings and friends palaces O The relationship and career palaces 
O The children and property palaces 
O The wealth and karmic luck palaces O The health and elders palaces  
When looking at your chart, notice which decad e (life palace) you are currently transitioning 
through. Each life palace brings a new beginning-the opportunity to  change your way of life and 
to see things in a different light. A change in decades can also bring upheavals, but the middle of 
each decade is considered the pinnacle or high point of the period. The palace corresponding to 
your chronological age and the energies containe d there are also very important to examine, 
along with the self/d estiny palace itself 
In addition, one of the 12 animal earthly branches is assigned to each of your life palaces. Each 
animal provides a distinct character , or "flavor," to its particular  palace. For example, if you find 
the Goat in your offspring palace, this indicates  creative, gentle, and ar tistic children who will 
tend to be lazy and difficult to motivate. If the life palace is: 
O In the sign of the Rat, it indicates con cealment, charm, and frugality, and the yang Water 
element. 
O In the sign of the Ox, it indicates endurance, stability, family, firmness, and country, and the 
yin Earth element. 
O In the sign of the Tiger, it indicates nobil ity, courage, and action, and the yang Wood element. O In the sign of the Rabbit, it indicates th e arts, refinement, det achment, and the yin Wood 
element. 
O In the sign of the Dragon, it indicates unpredic tability, drama, and vitality, and the yang Earth 
element. 
O In the sign of the Snake, it indicates wisdom , gradual development, physical beauty, and the 
yin Fire element. 
O In the sign of the Horse, it indicates deci siveness, freedom, and speech, and the yang Fire 
element. O In the sign of the Goat, it indicates artistic talent, propriety, benefactors, wealth, and the yin 
Earth element. 
O In the sign of the Monkey, it indicates youthfu lness, humor, and irrepressibility, and the yang 
Metal element. 
O In the sign of the Rooster, it indicates application, resourcefu lness, and candid speech, and the 
yin Metal element. 
O In the sign of the Dog, it indicates anxiet y, watchfulness, and loyalty, and the yang Earth 
element. O In the sign of the Pig, it indicates resignati on, chivalry, and physical comforts, and the yin 
Water element. 
We will discuss these animal signs and the specia l features they contribute in Chapter 13. Next, 
let's examine the various stars and their meanings. 
  
 
  
The traditional Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is calculated  using the Chinese lunar calendar and the four 
pillars, which shows the placemen t of the King/Emperor star. This star, called Zi Wei, is the 
most powerful ming energy and the pivotal point ar ound which the entire chart is built. In Taoist 
spiritual cultivation, the Zi Wei star has great si gnificance and is consider ed the pathway to the 
highest spiritual realms. Take sp ecial note of where this star en ergy is located in your chart. Before beginning, it will be helpful to familiarize  yourself with the placement of the main star 
energies in your life chart. Depending on your birth data, stars will be placed in one of 12 life 
palaces in your birth chart. The star(s) placed in  your destiny palace is referred to as your Ming 
Gong Zhu Xin ("main life star") and specifies your  personal characteristics and general luck in 
life. Following is an overview of the main star energies and a general de scription of each one.

Following is an explanation of the major star energies we will use in Zi Wei Dou Shu. The 
significance of the 14 major star s will be explained furthe r in subsequent chapters. 
The Rulers: The Four Leading Imperial Energies Zi Wei is the leading energy of Chinese astrol ogy, and the focal point of the Zi Wei Dou Shu 
astrological system. Where it falls in your char t will be the most powerful, favored palace and 
decade of your life, so take special  note of where it is placed. Zi Wei is authoritative, pioneering, 
conquering, farsighted, and hot te mpered. The emperor star brings luck, wea lth, authority, 
prestige, protection and rescue to  the life palace in which it is pl aced. It displays all the qualities 
of a strong, wise, courageous monarch and a na tural pioneering leader who looks at the big 
picture. This energy is ambitious, demanding and royal. When placed in the destiny palace, its 
imperial status is ambitious. With favorable stars accompanying it, it produces virtue, leadership, 
and strong character. When it is found alone or  accompanied by bad stars, it can become an 
irrational, hotheaded, extreme energy. It is very  lucky to find the Zi We i star placed in your 
career palace, as you may achieve greatness in your line of work. 
Tian Fu symbolizes guarding the treasury of th e King and represents grea t wealth. It is often 
found in the destiny of great l eaders and entrepreneurs. This major prosperity energy quietly builds fortunes. When found in a woman's chart, Tian Fu reveals a sophisticated and powerful 
woman who may also feel isolated at times. Prosperity, possessions, preservation, caution, and 
integrity are the cornerstones of this energy. Fo und in the destiny pal ace, it produces a careful 
and detail-oriented person whose parents and elders  played an important role in forming his or 
her character and personality. Where this star is placed is where you will amass substantial 
possessions and assets. It suggest s inheritance and benefactors. If poorly aspected, however, it 
can represent the white collar criminal or embezzler. 
Wu Qu is a powerful leadership energy of the im perial or royal group. It  represents authority, 
and is responsible for entrepreneurial skills. This  star indicates good luck with wealth, but also 
solitude, firmness, stubbornness, independence, and impatience. This star represents a strong and 
decisive leader who figuratively leads his or her army into battle. It symbolizes wealth, 
leadership, entrepreneurial skills, handicrafts,  and metals. Wu Qu is an independent and 
impatient energy, sometimes bringing activity premat urely in the life palace where it falls. It 
reveals a strong personality when found in the destiny palace. 
Tian Xiang is the emperor's minister, or general. It is a more passive energy than the other three 
imperial stars, and prefers to stay in the background rather than be in the spotlight. It is a loyal and hardworking energy of support and assistance. Bearing the seal of the emperor, Tian Xiang 
endorses verdicts that are passed down; therefore, its outstanding f eatures are responsibility and 
accountability. This star also in dicates the presence of a "right-hand man." With Tian Xiang, 
things tend to occur in twos. It represents repe tition, helpfulness, respon sibility, influence, and 
embroilment. Whether it is influencing for good or becoming embroiled in the bad, when placed 
in the destiny palace, it reveals an individual who gets involved. 
The Fighters: The Four Major Martial Energies 
Sha Qi is the leading en ergy in the martial group of stars. It s key features are aggression, force, 
severity, strategy, independence, a nd aloofness. It is an ambitious , reckless, hasty energy, with 
organizing and ordering abilities. When found in  the destiny palace, this conquering star 
presages disquiet and chaos. It reveals clashes,  power struggles, and turmoil in the family of 
origin. It also expresses an iron will, eager and conquering, and a cool-headed strategist, the 
power behind the scenes that must be reckone d with. Sha Qi commands respect in any life 
palace; however, it brings obstinacy, chaos, a nd rashness. This most powerful of the martial 
energies reveals much turbulence, adventure, ex citement, and even danger wherever it is placed. 
Its specific location indicates an area of our lives where we tend to  see things in black and white 
and where we will not compromise. Po Jun is an ambitious, intense, and authoritativ e force. A mover by natu re, this star embraces 
new things and discards the old and the obsolete.  Po Jun is a strong and aggressive star that 
shatters and builds back up; it breaks down the ol d and makes way for the new. If it is found in 
someone's destiny palace, it can make that pers on pretty tough to get along with. Guided 
properly, however, he or she can learn to create good things from bad situa tions. This star is all 
about "out with the old and in w ith the new." It is also hope and fiery passion. This star energy is 
constantly in the thick of battle; it charges fo rward, uproots, tears down, and rebuilds. The life palace where this star is placed experiences upheavals and a lot of reorganization, so if you find 
this star in your chart, hold on tight and fasten your seat belt! 
Lian Zhen is either pure virtue or pure vice, wickedness or innocence. Th is potent star reveals 
love affairs, aggression, and pow er. It indicates either respec tability, honesty and virtue; or 
debauchery, dissipation, and licen tiousness. This star has no gr ey areas or temperate middle 
zones. Lian Zhen is also one of the "peach bl ossoms"-those stars associated with romance, 
flirting, and love affairs. If pos itively positioned, it can bring success in dealing others; if poorly 
positioned; it can bring problems with infideli ty, gambling, or alcoholism. Lian Zhen, the 
crimson passion star, represents blood relatives , emotions, the arts, politics, privacy, and 
femininity having to do with yin, female ener gy. You can expect plenty of romantic drama 
wherever this "passion" star is placed in a chart. 
Tan Lang can either motivate you to get much done  or make you very greedy and impatient. Like 
Lian Zhen, it is an energy of extremes. It is the main energy of sexuality and danger. Love and 
problems linked with love occur wherever it is pl aced. Its essence is indulgence, sensuality, and 
magnetism. Wherever it appears in your chart, yo u will experience relationship turbulence in that 
palace. This star can indicate exhaustive rounds of  meetings and celebrations. It has also been 
connected with fights, power struggles, and trium phs or painful failures in matters of the heart. 
Those with this star in their destiny palace are full of sensual magnetism, artistic talent, and 
eloquence. These souls love the arts, languages,  good wine, romance, and all the pleasures of 
life. They may have an interest in metaphysics, religion, and spirituality, as well, but can become 
frustrated with their desires and impetuous nature. 
The Supporters and Adapters: The Six Major Psyc ho-S oci a[/Li terary (Humanitarian) Energies 
T'ai Yang, the sun, brings a very public and "i n the limelight" energy. It  indicates success and 
popularity in whatever life palace it is found i n, and bestows intellectual, literary, and public 
performance abilities. In the des tiny palace, it indicates success w ith a crowd, being in the public 
eye, awareness, and prominence. It is asso ciated with pure male yang energy, masculinity, 
openness, status, and elegance. The sun stands fo r all that is fiery, cleansing, and positive. 
Elegant, expansive and expressive, it can reveal  an area of life in which we are boastful and 
blunt. 
Ju Men represents a great door; as such, it is the energy of transition and change. It also 
represents the mouth, and reveal s a convincing orator and spea ker. Similar to Mercury in 
Western astrology, it is the astral signature of a consummate communicator. It also symbolizes 
litigation, privacy, caution, and suspicion. Po sitively expressed, Ju  Men provides a good 
reputation and outstanding rhetorical or speaking abilities. Negatively expressed, it can indicate a 
problem with "foot-in-mouth disease." Flanked by negative stars or the obstruction catalyst, it 
also reveals gossip, slande r, or a bad reputation. It is not an auspicious energy to find in the 
spousal palace, where it can indicate cont roversy and arguments with a partner. 
Tian Ji represents strategi c planning and innovative ideas. A pioneering spirit, mechanical 
ability, and physical agility are brought to the life pa lace in which this star is placed. Its presence 
indicates movement and speed, and can reveal  that money is active, dynamic, and moving. However, the inconsistency of this energy can cause instability. When found in the destiny 
palace, this star indicates someone who learns  quickly and is a great negotiator. In the 
relationship palace, it can represent instability in a marriage. 
T'ai Yin, the moon, represents the mother, the wife, and the earth, as well as "feminine" traits: 
imagination, psychic skills, sens itivity, and intuition. It imparts spiritual gifts and a strong sense 
of the sacred. It also represents  the soft nest of comfort and abundance. If the moon falls in your 
destiny palace, it bestows psychic and extrasen sory abilities. Repr oduction, tranquility, and 
hidden wealth are also gifts of the moon. It  reveals a strong connection with women and 
accumulates wealth quietly and discreetly. 
Tian Tong is the relaxed lover of  life. It represents emotions, enjoyment, entertainment, and 
sensitivity. This star is gentle, fun-loving, a nd concerned with humanitarian pursuits. It is 
contented by nature, retiring, and happy to let othe rs shine. It is a grac ious energy that leans 
toward spiritual subjects. This star reveals a person who will spend mu ch time in idealistic 
contemplation and daydreaming. It is a leisurely, joyous, and peaceful star; those with it in their 
destiny palace are frequently polite, humble, and at ease. They see no point in antagonizing 
others unnecessarily. If Tian Tong is found in the career palace, any pursuit that involves 
enjoyment, recreation, leisure, or entertainment is  highly favored. This star of contentment also 
brings a love of luxury and the good things in life. It can indica te where you will have an easy 
time of things and where you might be a little lazy. It also indicates what aspect of life you will 
tend to over-romanticize. 
Tian Liang represents protection, longevity, lateness, solitude, aging, and litigation. This 
beautiful energy also sy mbolizes the elderly, medication, insu rance, accounting, numbers. It also 
has the practical connotation of housing and the environment. This  is a lucky star that upholds 
principles and embraces orderliness. Its pres ence in the destiny palace ensures that major 
disasters and setbacks are averted, or at least diminished. Tian Liang represents passage through 
challenging times before reaping the harvest. Found in the destiny palace, it reveals an individual

the destiny palace of religious leaders. Those with  Tian Liang in their destiny palace help others 
enthusiastically, in the way an ol der sibling takes care of the younger ones. This star is the astral 
signature of a priest, judge, or high-ranking official. Problem-solving and longevity are the key 
words with this star. 
The Four Lucky Royal J ewels 
Zuo Fu brings yang Earth assistance and enhances  wealth and prominence. It stands for honor, 
kindness, and acceptance. It is a helper in whatev er life palace it is found. It always strives for 
the best, motivating the individual to reach for the stars. Ever the optimist, this star can see its 
way safely through any crisis. It possesses great karmic wealth a nd brings relief and protection 
from the difficult stars or  the obstruction catalyst. 
You Bi brings glowing, yin Water energy, which symbolizes a constant flow of assistance, 
particularly in matters of the heart. It is most fortunate to find it in your  relationship palace. It 
supplies honor, kindness, and assistance in whatever life palace it is found in. Tian Kui brings yang Fire energy and assistance fr om benefactors, elders, mentors, superiors, 
and generally supportive people. It makes recogniti on possible. The entire life is enhanced by 
this star. If you find it in your ch art, expect the appearance of helpful individuals. Where Tian 
Kui shines, luck seeks you out in the form of a timely helping hand. You may not be able to 
recognize these helpful people in the moment, but  you will definitely recognize this star's 
influence in retrospect. 
Tian Yue brings yin Fire ener gy and opportunities stemming from rules, regulations, policies, 
and authorities. It brings fa vorable contacts with the opposite sex and helpful people who guide, 
protect, and points you in the ri ght direction. The life palace wher e it is placed, suggests from 
where this assistance will come. 
The Major Indicators of Intelligence and Talent Wen Qu brings yin Water energy, natural talent, and intelligence. It indicates  a more informal or 
nontraditional education, especially in metaphysic s or spiritual subjects. Verbal skills are 
indicated, as well as fame from utilizing this gift . Wen Qu often appears in the destiny palace of 
those with artistic abilities and hi ghly developed senses. This artist ic star also applies to self-
expression, music, and the performing arts. 
Wen Chang brings yang Metal energy, sophisticated social graces, the gift of persuasion, and a 
more formal or traditional education in time- honored subjects. Exceptional talent in writing is 
indicated, as well as the potential  to become famous by using this talent. This profound teaching 
and speaking energy brings lively, in telligent, lucid, and clear discou rse. This star also concerns 
literary matters, public e ducation, and the arts. 
The Signposts: The Four Life Milestones 
Hong Luan indicates marriage, romantic associations, love, and possible pregnancy. It is a 
milestone energy of love and romance. When this  star aligns every 12 years with the original 
birth position, romantic turning points (betrothal, engagement, or beginning of new relationship) 
occur. This enchanted star fo rms an auspicious pair with the happiness/joy (birth) star. 
Tian Yao indicates enjoyment of the arts and a knack for entertaining, networking, and 
merriment. It is also an energy of romance-cla ndestine affairs, chance en counters, and frivolous 
romantic pursuits are found along its path. With  Tian Yao, an accidental encounter with a 
stranger can send the heart aflutter and become th e turning point in a onc e ordinary existence. 
The life palace this romantic energy is placed in  will indicate the decad e when this encounter 
will occur, and will delin eate the specifics surrounding that encounter. 
Tien Xi indicates celebrations, great happiness, and favorable act ivities. Like Hong Luan, it can 
presage major events such as marriage, the birth of children, or an important karmic relationship. 
Tian Xing brings difficult situations and "heaven ly punishment." Found in the destiny palace, it 
reveals an influential, fair-minded person with go od leadership skills who can also feel alone and isolated at times. This milestone  star can indicate a great loss, a death, or catalytic event that 
brings with it a new perspective on life. It reveals new horizons that  open from adversity. 
The Main Energy of Travel, Change, and Movement 
Tian Ma brings pure yang Fire, mobility, activity,  and action wherever it is found. This "steed" is 
a powerful stallion that flies acro ss the sky with both grace and fortitude. In the destiny palace, it 
reveals an extremely busy individual -the busier, the better, in fact . Wherever it is found in the 
birth chart will divulge where change, travel, work ing abroad, or definite forward movement will 
occur. Tian Ma shines on high achievers. The Main Energy of Money 
Lu Cun (literally, "keeping wealth")  generates wealth in the life palace in which it is found. This 
star contributes cautious and c onservative yin Earth energy that brings financial and spiritual 
wealth and the ability to avert danger. A definite enhancer to any life palace,  this star brings the 
good to new heights and thwarts the detrimental powers of dark stars. It is an indication of added 
protection and prosperity. This is also a healing star-the decade in which it is active will see a 
new beginning in which past hurts or losses are finally put to rest. 
The Six Sha )'ao: The Dark Stars These stars hamper the major stars and negate the positive effects of assis ting energies. In certain 
situations, they can help mitigate the negative imp act of some of the more difficult stars (such as 
Sha Qi) in a life palace. The pal ace or palaces in which these star s are located will indicate when 
you will be prone to misfortune or untimely d eath caused by accidents or unexpected tragedies. 
From a more positive perspective,  they exist as a balancing fact or and as a reminder of possible 
misfortune. 
Huo Xing generates unfavorable events that tend  to happen quickly. Its presence casts a dark 
cloud over the palace in which it is placed. When  found in the destiny palace, it reveals an 
intense, controlling, and abrasive personality, especially when it is accompanied by other 
negative stars. In the destiny pa lace, it can indicate a difficult childhood, an early departure from 
the parents, or other events that occur suddenly. More positively, the yang Fire energy of this star 
brings troubles into the open. 
Ling Xing also brings troubles and unfavorable events that occur quickly; however, these 
troubles tend to be hidden. Sneaky and underhande d efforts may accompany this nasty little star. 
Found in the destiny palace, it reveals a chao tic childhood and many challenges throughout life. 
Like Huo Xing, it also indicates an intense,  abrasive, and controlling personality. 
Qing Yang brings yang Metal energy in the form of problems that arise suddenly, sabotage, and 
failure. These issues are in the open and can be predicted, but not avoided.  This star indicates 
weapons, fighting, and injury, and can bring life-threatening acci dents or attacks. Tuo Luo brings yin Metal energy, and represen ts unexpected problems that are hidden. Its 
unexpected and undetected nature causes anxi ety that can only be felt by the individual. 
Obstacles, blockages, and delays may cause additional difficulties. Tuo Luo doesn't bring 
lifethreatening danger, bu t it can tarnish a good reput ation with gossip or mockery, so caution is 
required wherever this star falls in a chart. Be on the lookout for subve rsive gossip or slander 
from within your own ranks. 
Di Kong brings wastefulness and the careless squandering of resources. This yin Fire energy 
produces an unstable income and encourages unw ise expenditures. This is obviously an unlucky 
star to find in the wealth palace. This dark star brings with it at least one major setback in the 
palace in which it is placed. Di he is the most powerful of the dark stars. It brings turbulence , loss, crisis, and destruction in 
the palace in which it is found. This star wrecks havoc on the emotions and will reveal where 
constant interference will occur. The location of this energy can also give  you the reason for your 
present existence. 
  
 
  
In addition to the major stars, there are four pow erful transforming stars, or catalysts. These life-
changing stars are significant ke ys to interpreting your birth chart. The four transforming 
catalysts enhance, change, and convert the various stars in different ways. Three of the catalysts 
are helpful, and one is harmful. 
The Helpful Catalysts O Power: Hua Quan (literally, "transforms aut hority") brings direc tion, authority, power, 
influence, and supremacy. This catalys t transforms the star it is attached to into leadership, a high 
level of management, clout, ambition, determination, and initiative. It transforms into authority 
and is associated with the Fire element. 
O Fame: Hua Ke (literally, "transforms success" ) brings success, repu tation, recognition, self-
satisfaction, and fame. It transforms into a good na me and is associated with the Wood element. 
Personal distinction shines wherever this catalyst is placed. 
O Prosperity: Hua Lu (literally, "transforms fortune") enhances the flow of fortune and good 
luck. It transforms into riches and is associated with the Metal element. It  enhances the flow of 
fortune, riches, and luck. It also tu rns unfavorable matters favorable. 
O Obstruction: Hua Ji (literally, "transforms to  trouble"), also called the tribulation or cloud 
catalyst, is a very inauspicious star that negatively transforms other stars, situations, and life 
palaces. It usually indicates obs tacles and dangers and is associ ated with the Water element. 
The effects of Hua Quan on other stars 
Zi Wei: Power makes the quick-tempered empero r positively hot-headed. This is a stubborn, 
unbending energy, especially early on in life. When the power catalyst is a ttached to this potent 
star it produces a megalomaniacal greed for power. Great temperance will be required in order to 
achieve success. 
Po Jun: The talent to create something from nothing as well as the drive to break through barriers 
into new territory will be enhan ced. The power catalyst attached to Po Jun creates a powerful 
desire to mastermind project s and launch new ventures. 
Wu Qu: The power catalyst augments the effects of the commander, which suggests that you will 
take charge and have a firm hold on the reins of the life palace in which it is placed. When these 
two stars combine, it reveals self-empowerment, quick reac tions, and intense responses. 
Tan Lang: The ability to mingle and entertain is  enhanced. Socializing, indulgence, sensuality, 
physical attraction, and metaphysics are the key words when these two are attached. Power 
comes from attention from the opposite sex, mee ting influential people, and social networking. 
Tian Ji: The positive characteristics of movement  are enhanced. Mobilit y, strategy, and agility 
are all improved in the life palace in which this  combination is found. With Hua Quan, new ideas 
come quickly, but an excess of  choices creates indecision. 
Tian Tong: This star's ability to build fortune s from nothing is enhanced by the power catalyst. 
Hua Quan also insures that the contentment star will have an aptitude for handling people, and 
will be able to enjoy leisure activities of all kinds. T'ai Yin: The moon's wealth energy and mone y management abilities are boosted by the power 
catalyst. Power comes, in part, from female supporters and associations with women. Calm, 
composed, and a good strategist, you plot for victory in a subtle way. 
T'ai Yang: The sun's outgoing energy, status , and reputation are a ll boosted by the power 
catalyst. The sun with the power catalyst attached bri ngs the public, crowds, and male supporters 
to your aid. Bored with tedious details, you excel at managing the larger picture. 
Ju Men: These two stars together  yield an articulate master communicator, public speaker, or 
spokesperson. Found in one of the relationship palaces, however, this combination reveals 
censure and disputes. Tian Liang: Power added to the scholar enhances  protection, solitude, liti gation, and injury. This 
combination yields the inspector : loyal, lonely, and litigious, the inspector examines matters 
closely and reports its findings to  the emperor. If these stars co mbine in your chart, being less 
rigid will serve you better. Focus on academic  achievement, knowledge, and good judgment. 
The effects of Hua Ke on other stars Zi Wei: The emperor star with the success cata lyst attached invites fame, recognition, and 
celebrity through groundbreaking organization and leadership. If accompanied by dark stars in 
the same life palace, this combination can i ndicate gaining popularity through misguided or 
unwise channels. 
Wu Qu: The success catalyst brings in wealth, al ong with both personal and professional success. 
Known for contributing to a fiery temperament, this combination produces a fiery temperament 
and a blunt, direct personal ity. Exercise tact in your  communication with others. 
Tian Ji: The success catalyst highlights the chief advisor's fondness for strategy and action. 
Depending on the life palace in wh ich it is placed, this combination achieves fame and success 
via novel or groundbreaking ideas. This combination reveals an intelligent,  physically active fast 
learner. 
T'ai Yang: Success comes with this combination vi a the media, the entertainment industry, or the 
public. However, this may be an isolated type of success. You would be a dvised to look closer at 
real benefits rather than at the mere pursuit of reputation. Despite be ing popular with many, you 
will always chafe against rivalry and expe rience a certain amount of competition. 
Tian Liang: This is a very auspicious combin ation of energies and a ssures success in higher 
learning, knowledge, and literary pu rsuits. Focus more on academic pursuits rather than material 
wealth or possessions. Academic success will bring you the fame, good reputation, and material 
blessings you desire. 
Tian Fu: The success catalyst adds power to the palace vault's many resources. This combination 
can create a financial wizard, especially when it is  found in the wealth pal ace. It is indicative of 
success with money and an apti tude for financial topics. Wen Qu: The success catalyst influe nces how a person promotes his or her name, reputation, and 
image. This combination reveals success due to eloquence, and in realms such as metaphysics, 
astrology, and spirituality. 
Wen Chang: This combination reveals a talent for writing and all visual forms of art. You have a 
more formal education, skill set, and scope of knowledge. The success catalyst brings good luck 
in examinations. There is a potential for fame with this special combination of star energy and 
transforming catalyst. 
T'ai Yin: With this combination, wealth, success, reputation, and fame come from associations 
with females or feminine supporters. You will be well-known within a close circle of friends, and you may use your intuition and psychic skills to become prominent. 
The effects of Hua Lu on other stars 
Po Jun: With the wealth catalyst attached to the demolisher star, don't be afraid to discard 
anything that doesn't work, as success will result from innovation and restructuring. Wu Qu: With this combination, you have your own particular brand of skills and talent. You are 
an expert when it comes to putting plans into ope ration, and will be greatly rewarded financially 
for this. Take the reins of any project and see good results. Prosperity comes to the palace where 
it is found. 
Lian Zhen: This star is all about the emotions ; with the fortune catalys t it brings happiness 
(emotional wealth). Blood relations or family members bring assets or introduce auspicious 
situations. 
Tan Lang: This combination assures wealth if you become involved in socializing and other 
pleasurable activities. Look for the hidden fina ncial opportunities in networking, partying, and 
social liaisons. Physical exerci se, dance, and body-building can also bring financial rewards. 
Tian Ji: This combination of stars ensures uni mpeded progress and quality of work in your 
career, but not necessarily great wealth. You are a good strategist and will gain financial security 
through lateral moves, rather than by climbing the corporate ladder. 
Tian Tong: This combination bri ngs great pleasure in life due to wealth, but not necessarily from 
a large fortune or inheritance. Wealth come s from activities connected with enjoyment, 
entertainment, leisure, or recreation. The wealth catalyst also uses OPM (o ther people's money) 
to quietly build a fortune from nil. 
T'ai Yin: The fortune catalyst multiplies the m oon's wealth energies tenfold. Fortune is accrued 
via associations, businesses, trad es, or partnerships with women. 
T'ai Yang: The sun symbolizes the crowd, the media, public matters, and males; from these 
sources, wealth flows. When the fortune catalys t combines with sun, the level of wealth will depend on the reputation, status, an d relative level of fa me of the individual. The more popular 
and famous the person is, the more money he or she will enjoy. 
Ju Men: With this combination, fortunes can be made via speaking skills. Professions that entail 
public speaking, debate, or convers ational skills, such as the la w, sales, teaching, or training 
others, are favored financially. 
Tian Liang: This combination i ndicates heirlooms, estates, or a family business. Many obstacles 
must be overcome to achieve wealth, and even then, problems may still follow. Financial 
corruption looms with this combination, so it is  critical to keep all financial transactions 
aboveboard and beyond reproach. 
The effects of Hua Ji on other stars 
Wu Qu: In this placement, the commander's qui ck thinking lacks thoroughness. The obstruction 
catalyst has the commander's hands tied, so this combination is inauspicious for the execution of 
plans. There will also be dangers related to sharp metal objects. Lian Zhen: This combination indicates dise ases of the blood and heart and gynecological 
disorders. Serious physical injuries with blood lo ss, as well as problems and disputes with blood 
relatives, are also indicated. The life palace in which this difficult combination rests will likely 
reveal a broken heart. 
Tan Lang: This star has to do with sensuality, socializing, and vices; obstructed, it can become 
self-indulgence, trouble with l ove affairs, compulsions, and addictions. Trouble and scandal can 
come from socializing and hobbies. When this combination is found in the health palace, 
sexually transmitted diseases can be a result. 
Wen Qu: With this combination, there will be a price to pay fo r errors in speech. Slander, 
arguments, and endless complaints are the mala dies that come with an obstructed Wen Qu. 
Failure is brought on by arrogance or trying to impress others with your knowledge. 
Wen Chang: Errors in the written word cause calamity. Libel, problems with legal documents, 
and difficulties regarding certi fications, diplomas, or licensing occur when the obstruction 
catalyst is attached to Wen Chang. Doubl e-check all documents and contracts. 
Tian Ji: This difficult combination results in im pediments to movement and obstructions to the 
thought process. Long-term plans fail to materialize,  and there may be losses and delays in travel 
plans, deliveries, and/or communications. Bad ch oices and failure are brought about by too many 
changes. 
Tian Tong: The emotions take a devastating blow with the obstru ction catalyst attached. Life 
may feel like an emotional rolle rcoaster. Mental stress can bl ock the enjoyment of leisure 
activities and entertainment. Also, watch out fo r disasters at play, during free time, or while 
vacationing. T'ai Yin: This combination reveals emotional probl ems, self-imposed stress, and inner turmoil. It 
is a very bad omen for wealth investments. Th e moon is dealt a blow by the obstruction catalyst, 
investment are devastated. Pr oblems with women, as well as economic loss brought about by a 
female, are also indicated. 
T'ai Yang: An obstructed sun indicates disapprova l from crowds, the majority, and/or the public. 
In eclipse, ailments of the head, eyes, and hear t will come to light. When an obstructed sun is 
placed in any of the "people" pa laces, be cautious of males and of attracting disputes easily. 
Ju Men: Ju Men represents the mouth; combined with Hua Ji, it can cause you to speak tactlessly 
and/or bring problems having to do with speech. Ar guments, slander, lawsuits, and suspicions 
are all exacerbated with this combina tion, and losses may remain undiscovered. 
  
 
  
The focal point of a Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is the self or desti ny palace, or ming gong. It reveals

uncover our natural abilities and to  see what life will bring our way. Depending on the date and time of your birth, one or more of 14 major stars will end up in your

xin. Using the CD that accompanies this book, calcu late your Zi Wei Dou S hu chart to determine

Write your destiny stars here: 
Write down which of the 12 animal branch signs occupies your destiny palace:  
The first step of Zi Wei chart interpretation is  figuring out which soul group you are a part of 
This is determined by what stars are placed in your destiny palace. The soul groups include the 
imperial (royal) group, the martial (aggre ssive) group, and the ps ycho-social/literary 
(humanitarian) group. Yours is an imperial or royal destiny if Zi Wei, Wu Qu, Tian Fu, or Tian 
Xiang resides in your destiny palace. These energi es are found in the self/destiny palaces of the 
"rulers"-those souls favored by birth to lead, to guide,  and to be key figures in this life. Yours is a 
martial destiny if Tan Lang, Po Jun, Lian Zhen, or  Sha Qi dwells in your destiny palace. These 
energies are the fiercest of Chinese astrology and are found in the self /destiny palaces of the 
"fighters"-those souls characteri zed by ambitious, aggressive, and au thoritative action. Yours is a 
psycho-social/literary destiny if Tai Yang, Ju Men, Tian Tong, Tian Ji, Tian Liang, or Tai Yin is 
placed in your destiny palace. These energies are found in the self palaces of the "teachers"-those 
governed by intellectual, diplomatic, or humanitarian interests and pursuits. 
What does it mean if one of th e following major royal (ruling) en ergies is found in the destiny 
palace? 
Zi Wei: It can be lonely at the top. Ask anyone with Zi Wei in his or her destiny palace. Rulers 
and leaders by divine right, those with the emperor star placed in this critical life palace are the 
movers and shakers in this world. This star represents luck, wealt h, authority, prestige, 
protection, and rescue. Those with this most powerful of stars in their destiny palace are fated to be amongst the "royal class"-those souls favored by birth to lead and to guide. This leading 
energy of the Chinese astrologic al cosmos indicates a sophisti cated, thoughtful, responsible 
person who may experience isolation and loneliness at  times. In general, however, this is a strong 
individual with an objective, farsighted view of  life, able to see problems and challenges from all 
angles. There is an excellent chance for fame a nd fortune. This is the classic archetype of the 
wise king or queen who is destined to be in a position of authority and re spect. This king of stars 
rules the destiny palaces of judge s, magistrates, CEOs, and heads of state. The Zi Wei star 
reveals a soul who is authoritative, pioneering, conquering, and farsighted. Those with this royal 
destiny are leaders in every se nse of the word. They wield influence and evoke respect. 
Tian Fu: This star in the des tiny is the astral si gnature of a kind, conservative soul who has 
chosen to lead a peaceful life. With Tian Fu (l iterally, "heavenly luck") in the destiny palace, 
finances play an important role, for better or fo r worse. Typically, however , it is for the better. 
This star reveals a conservative and grounded pe rson who enjoys success in examinations and 
who will have every opportunity to  obtain great wealth. This is mainly due to a careful, cautious, 
and frugal nature. Parents and elders play an im portant role in forming this person's character 
and personality, which will ultimately bring success later on in life. Wu Qu: Ah, the power behind the throne? This majo r star is the leadership energy of the royal 
group, responsible for entrepreneurial skills, good luck, and wealth, but also solitude, firmness, 
and stubbornness. Someone with this star in his or her destiny palace will be the "right hand 
man" of the powerful and the infl uential. It also indicates a st rong, resilient, independent, yet 
impatient person who may tend to act too quickly . Wu Qu represents a decisive leader who 
figuratively leads his or her army  into battle. People with Wu Qu in their destiny palace are 
usually slightly built, but with a resounding, resonant voice. Th is individual will be an 
implementer, involved with the details of putting ideas to work. 
Tian Xiang: This star provides support and backin g to others, as well as personal responsibility 
and influence. Also known as "the mirror," Tian Xiang indicates duplicati on or twinning: a twin 
birth, two sets of parents, two professions, two marriages, and so on. With this energy of 
duplication, you must be careful not to repeat past mistakes; break out of this circle and you will 
move forward. You are likely cautious and met hodical, and recognized by the care and detail you 
apply to your dress, home, and office. Responsible  and interested in details others may have 
missed, those with Tian Xiang in their destiny pa lace are upright and fit into everyone's ideal of 
the big brother or sister. This helpful soul goes out of his or her way to help others. Whether it is 
influencing for good or getting embroiled in the ba d, this is a person who loves to get involved. 
What does it mean if one of th e following major martial (aggressi ve, fighting) energies is found 
in the destiny palace? 
Sha Qi: Power, prestige, and presence are the call ing cards of this major martial star. These are 
the bad boys and girls extraordinaire, and danger is their middle name. Risk, turmoil, and, above 
all, supremacy is their lifeblood. Sha Qi (litera lly, "bad energy") is th e leading star of the 
ambitious, reckless, and hasty martial group. It bri ngs suspicion and obstinacy, as well as an iron 
will, an aggressive character, and fearsome efficiency. With Sha Qi, there will always be a 
certain amount of going against the grain and chafing under restraint. 
Po Jun: Brave, arrogant, and dashing, those with Po Jun presiding over their destiny palace 
reinvent themselves daily and change their colo rs more often than a chameleon. Today's project 
is not necessarily tomorrow's passion, as this star represents "out with th e old and in with the 
new." Hopefulness, aggressiveness, a pioneer ing spirit, and an impulsive temperament 
characterize those with Po Jun ruling their dest iny palace. They are always willing to dissolve 
ties to make way for bigger and better things. They al so love to take risks. They can't tolerate a 
stagnant environment, but change for the sake of change may overtax their resources. For the 
person with Po Jun in his or her destiny palace, it will always pay to create a realistic plan and 
review it thoroughly before taking on the next battle. 
Lian Zhen: A little moderation may be sorely needed in the lives of those with Lian Zhen placed 
in their destiny palace. An "either-or" star, it reveals aggression, debauchery, and licentiousness, 
or respectability, honesty, and virtue. There is no temperate middle zone with this star presiding 
over the destiny palace. It repres ents blood relations, emotional issues, the arts, politics, and 
privacy. As one of the peach blossom stars, it is  also associated with romance, flirting, and 
affairs. Expressed positively, it can bri ng success and popularity. If poorly positioned, obstructed, or expressed negativ ely, however, Lian Zhen may produce a shady individual who 
has problems with infidelity, gambling, or alcoholism. Excesses may cause confinement. 
Tan Lang: This star is a major martial energy of extremes. In the destiny palace, it is a magnet to 
the opposite sex. It offers that certain special something to the personality, sexual pizzazz perhaps. Tan Lang has no trouble attracting playmate s; in fact, those with this major martial 
destiny fairly ooze sensuality. Because this is a martial star, however, it is also the energy of 
danger, of love affairs, of inte nse sensuality, and of problems li nked with love. This energy also 
represents indulgence, sensuousness,  the physique, and divination. This  star in the destiny palace 
reveals an individual who is curious, who love s metaphysics and spirituality, and who will have 
an appreciation for the arts, languages, good wine, ro mance, and all the sens ual pleasures of life. 
What does it mean if one of the following ma jor civil/literary (humanitarian, diplomatic) 
energies is found in the destiny palace? 
T'ai Yang: If you are outgoing, popular, and al ways on the go, Tai Yang may be shining 
prominently in your destiny palace. The sun reveal s a passionate, romantic, radiant soul who is 
more of a visionary. Male or female, those with Tai Yang placed in their destiny palace have a 
powerful masculine presence that is  chivalrous, noble, generous, al truistic, just, and blunt. They 
were born to be in the public eye in some wa y. Women are especially competent and ambitious. 
Tai Yang is an especially good energy for those in the legal profession, broadcasting, and any 
kind of publicity. Although people with this destiny are able to gain prominence with ease, it will be to their advantage to look for real and tangible benefits rather than merely running after fame 
and reputation. 
Tai Yin: The moon represents the mother, th e woman, night, the earth, female yin energy, 
imagination, sensitivity, intuition, reproduction, tr anquility, and wealth. It imparts spiritual gifts 
and reveals a strong connection to  women, as well as to men with the moon in their destiny 
palace. Calm and composed, with intuition borderi ng on the psychic, those with Tai Yin in their 
destiny palace are subtle, dee p, and discerning. Intelligent, well-known, and blessed with a 
firstrate social life, Moon natives enjoy the arts  and spiritual subjects immensely. However, due 
to their extreme sensitivity, they can be overly em otional and too easily influenced. These traits 
are enhanced if the person was born at night. Tian Tong: This political and ci vil-minded star bestows intellectu al, literary, administrative, and 
diplomatic abilities and qualities. This humanitari an, gracious, gentle, and peaceful energy brings 
unity to others. The primary faults here are unpredic tability and a lack of perseverance. This is a 
contented, relaxed lover of life who is happy to  let others shine. Goals and ambitions are 
accomplished through persuasion, reason, and teamwork. Tian Tong represents protection, 
longevity, and solitude. 
Tian Liang: This star is a power-hitter in the civi l/literary group of stars.  Those souls with Tian 
Liang in their destiny palace enthus iastically help others, just as  an older sibling cares for the 
younger ones. This star represents protection, longev ity, lateness, solitude, control, and litigation. 
It represents slow, organic growth, older in dividuals, and long-s tanding employees and 
associates who are in it for the long haul. Tian Liang is serious, respons ible, disciplined, and a little sad. When found in the destiny palace, it often indicate s difficult beginnings, Herculean 
efforts, and then success. This person has the ability to turn bad into  good; the good things tend 
to come later, after difficulties. W ith this star in the destiny pal ace, there is also a tendency to 
take on too much. This person will  have few real friends, but they  will be helpful and faithful, 
and often older. Many with this destiny become priests, judges, or hi gh-ranking officials, or 
engage in some type of public service. 
Tian Ji: Tian Ji represents unity and friendship, the heavenly force that drives the cosmos. This 
star of intelligence also represents strategy, a pi oneering spirit, mechanics, and agility. Placed in 
the destiny palace, it reveals mu ch movement-changes of residence, traveling, and new locales 
are likely in store. Those with Tian Ji in th eir destiny palace are often the power behind the 
throne. When we pick a flower, we must not forg et the humble bee that has prepared it; likewise, 
when we applaud a great singer, we must also  remember the sound engineer and stage manager 
who made it all possible. Similarly, Tian Ji re veals a soul who keeps everything and everyone on 
track. 
Ju Men: The "giant gate" star indicates that th ere will be many passages and changes in this life. 
This energy has a touch of mystery and the unusual.  It represents the mouth, and as such reveals 
a convincing orator or spokesperson. The spoken word and verbal communication will play an 
influential role for better (eloquence, articulation) or for worse (misunderstandings, verbal gaffes, and gossip). Those with this star in th eir destiny palace are c onsummate communicators; 
as such, they are ideally suited for careers in teaching, sales, politics, entertainment, and the law. When Jun Men rules the destiny palace, prospe rity does not come without competition and a 
great deal of discussion. Careers that rely on eloquence gain w ealth; however, be cautious and 
guard against arguments and/or contentiousness. 
One of the 12 animal signs of the zodiac, or ear thly branches, also occupies each life palace, 
including the destiny palace. This animal sign may differ from the sign of your birth year. Find 
the animal sign that is placed in your destiny pa lace. Then, look at the three directional groups, 
each of which contains four signs of the zodiac. Group 1 consists of the "four corn ers," or "posts": the Monkey, Snake, Tiger, and Pig. These four 
branches reside in one of the four corners of a Zi Wei chart. They have to do with movement, so 
someone with his or her ming gong (destiny) in a post corner will be perpetually on the move. 
Each of these signs may also invite problems unnecessarily, so the person's life path will likely 
be more chaotic in general. 
When the Monkey is found in the destiny palace, the person will be: O Changeable and contradictory-conf ident one minute, unsure the next. 
O Clever, witty, and skillful. O Poised and graceful-will excel at the performing arts. O Inconsistent-will experience gr eat gains, but also great losses ; better to marry late in life. When the Snake is found in the de stiny palace, the person will be: 
O Calm on the outside, but graspi ng and tumultuous on the inside. 
O Perfectionistic-can miss the main  point by focusing on the details. 
O Savvy in business and prudent with money, but can invite problems in these areas 
unnecessarily.

OO Prone to invite problems. Group 2 consists of the "four direc tions": the Rat, Rabbit, Horse, a nd Rooster. Each of these four 
branches resides in a palace asso ciated with the four cardinal di rections-North, South, East, and 
West. When these peach blossom branches (some times called the "four failures") are found in 
someone's destiny palace, partying, romanci ng, drinking, gambling, and overspending are 
usually the result. The arts or entertainment are where this person's charisma will help him/ her 
succeed. When the Rat is found in the des tiny palace, the person will be: 
O Distinctive, strong-wille d, poised, smart, and practical , with uncommon judgment. 
O Emotional, sensual, and easily seduced.

O Prone to arguing over trivial matters.

O Strong and independent; not open to the suggestions of others. 
O Arrogant a times, which aliena tes others or causes failure. 
O An avid traveler, particul arly to historical sites. 
Group 3 consists of four earths: the Dragon, Ox, D og, and Goat. Each of these four branches is 
associated with the earth element. They are also  called the "four graves," as earth is heavy and 
not easily moved or changed. Those with one of th ese branches placed in their destiny palace are 
easily stuck and have difficulty with change. They  must work harder than others; success comes 
only when they can break out of their ruts. 
When the Dragon is found in the destiny palace, the person will be: 
0 Intelligent, clever, and helpful. O Courteous, well-mannered, a nd tranquil in appearance. O Balanced, impartial, relaxed, unhurried, and sometimes a bit indecisive or too casual.

O Shy and sensitive, and seemingly easily irri tated; actually quite strong inside, however. 
O Idealistic, but must push hard to achieve concrete goals. O Narrow-minded; does not readily accept outside opinions or ideas. 
O Isolated and lonely at times. 
Now, let's move on to the other 11 palaces.

and others will assist you during travel. 
T'ai Yang: The sun in your travel palace indicates success when traveling and more success in 
your career when you are away from home. Fame , recognition, and status come to you after 
transferring to a foreign land. Your name will be etched on the hearts of many and your 
benevolence will be rewarded. Ju Men: This placement suggests that others sp eak poorly of you overseas. You could experience 
slander, gossip, and possibly litigation after moving to another country. Gossip also surrounds 
you when traveling. This causes you to  keep your activities hush-hush. 
Tian Ji: This star in your travel  palace indicates constant activ ity and movement. You will likely 
move to a foreign county and be kept both physi cally and mentally active.  You will have better 
luck making a living if you move far from your birthplace. Your restless nature will have no 
trouble with this ki nd of existence. 
T'ai Yin: With the moon in your travel pala ce, women will assist you on your travels and you 
will love to stay out late or travel at night. If you move to a foreign land, tranquility will follow 
you. You will receive much assistance when trav eling, allowing you to achieve your goals and 
enjoy an abundant harvest. You will gain respect and a helpful benefactor overseas. 
Tian Tong: This placement is an  indication of a turn for the wo rse after relocating to a foreign 
country. Watch for accidents or mishaps during vacations or leisure time. With dark stars 
accompanying Tian Tong in this palace, beware of vehicle accidents or injuries while on 
vacation. Despite this, you make friends easily while on your travels. 
Tian Liang: Older or elderly people assist you when travelin g. You gain respect overseas or 
away from home. You will overcome a certain am ount of turmoil if you move far from home or 
to a foreign place. This move will likely be permanent.   
 
  
This palace describes your body a nd your health in general, bo th mental and physical. Hidden 
illnesses that you may be prone to are also f ound here; this includes physical handicaps and 
internal disorders. When interp reting the health palace, stars represent body parts, and the dark 
stars, such as Huo Xing and Ling Xing, represent illness. The health palace is usually examined in c onjunction with the destiny palace. A favorable 
destiny palace can supersede even the most dismal health palace; conversely, if all stars in the 
health palace are favorable and the destiny palace is  obstructed or filled w ith dark energies, true 
health will be elusive. Both palaces must be  used to pinpoint weaknesses and evaluate your 
overall health. For example, if either the des tiny or the health palace contains Sha Qi, Qing 
Yang, Tuo Luo, Huo Xing, Di Jie, or Di Kong, they are weak and poorly placed. In this case, you 
may suffer continuous health misfor tunes and illness. Following is how the various star energies 
will affect your health palace. 
Zi Wei: The Zi Wei star represents the head, th e brain, and the area between the eyebrows. With 
other favorable energies, it reveals very good heal th throughout your life. Obstructed or with 
dark stars also present, you may suffer headac hes, dizziness, a weak nervous system, and/or 
insomnia. Zi Wei may cause problems in your digestive system, spleen, or stomach; you may 
experience indigestion, acid reflux, or  other problems with digestion. 
Tian Fu: There are usually only minor illnesses w ith Tian Fu, such as poor digestion or swollen 
legs. This star can also indicate stomach or di gestive problems, possible rib injuries, or lung 
weakness, but all in all, you w ill benefit from good health. There may be some circulatory 
problems, such as edema, when you are older. Found together with the Zi Wei star, it means that 
you are seldom ill and will enjoy excellent health. 
Wu Qu: Your lungs and respiratory system will be w eak if any of the dark stars are present in the 
health or destiny palace. Lungs, nose,  face, and teeth can all be at risk with this star. Because this 
star is connected with the Metal element, it can reveal injuries  from sharp metals or surgeries. 
Found together with Tian Xiang, a hidden disabling illness may surface. 
Tian Xiang: You may experience urinary system dysfunction, bla dder disease, edema, diabetes, 
and/or skin maladies and allerg ies (ringworm, psoriasis). With dark stars in tow, contagious 
diseases or hereditary illnesses may surface. Sha Qi: You will likely expe rience many illnesses during your childhood. Diseases of the 
respiratory system and/or breathing difficulties may also plague you. Your colon, large and small 
intestines, and rectal area are all susceptible to problems, as well. Hemorrhoids, impotence, and 
incontinence are found with Sh a Qi in the health palace. 
Po Jun: Po Jun brings misfortune and fre quent illnesses during childhood. Diseases and 
dysfunctions of the reproductive system (miscarriage, irregular or painful menstruation) and a 
host of genitourinary problems are frequently  seen. Disorders of the abdomen, kidneys, and 
bladder can also afflict you. Po Jun reveals poor health in general and chronic or hidden illnesses 
that show up later in life. 
Lian Zhen: You will be plagued with many h ealth problems such as insomnia, poor blood 
circulation, or heart disease late r on in life. However, the main issues with this star are 
psychological and emotional problems and diseas es of the nervous system. Diseases of the 
blood, bodily fluids, mouth, teeth, tongue, a nd lips are also frequently seen. Tan Lang: Representing love and problems with love, Tan Lang brings with it the potential for 
genitourinary disorders and sexually transmitted diseases. Diseases of the gall bladder, liver, and 
spleen are also seen. 
T'ai Yang: Tai Yang in the health palace rev eals problems with the head, eyes, heart, or 
circulatory system. Surrounded by favorable energi es, there are usually very few illnesses or 
physical mishaps; obstructed or accompanied by dark stars, however, the sun becomes eye pain, 
injury, or disease; bleeding in the brain; and diseases of blood qi (hi gh blood pressure, heart 
disease). 
Ju Men: There could be problems in and around the mouth area. Diseases of the throat, digestive 
system, stomach, esophagus, and duodenum are also possible. Frequent illnesses in childhood, 
including respiratory problems and ear, nose, an d throat infections, are also indicated. 
Tian Ji: Tian Ji can reveal probl ems with the liver, gall bladder, or nervous system. Alcoholism, 
emotional breakdowns, and ailments of the limbs or extremities are frequently seen. If the 
obstruction catalyst is attached or if it is surrounded by dark star s, Tian Ji reveals a wound that 
results in a scar, most likely on the forehead. There is also th e potential for hyperactivity, ADD, 
and learning disabilities due to in jury and/or emotional volatility. 
T'ai Ying: T'ai Ying placed in your health palace  puts you at risk for di abetes, edema, urinary 
tract disease, kidney depletion, and yin disord ers in women (miscarriage and infertility). 
Diseases and dysfunctions of the head and eyes, such as myopia and retinal degeneration (especially the right eye), are also seen with this  placement. Hidden or mysterious diseases of the 
genitourinary system and the breasts and psychological disturbances are particularly troublesome 
when T'ai Yin is obstructed or  met with the dark stars. 
Tian Tong: You will enjoy basi cally good health with the ex ception of some significant 
emotional or mental concerns. Obesity and wei ght-related issues, along with a tendency toward 
physical inactivity or lethargy, is frequently seen  when Tian Tong is found in the health palace. 
The kidneys, bladder, or urinary system may also be vulnerable if  this star is obstructed or 
accompanied by other difficult stars. 
Tian Liang: The spleen, liver, ga llbladder, and digestive system  may cause trouble. This star 
frequently also brings small but chronic health problems, but impressi ve longevity, as well. 
Combined with dark stars, it can indicate a brai n tumor or other cranial disease, a weak nervous 
system, arteriosclerosis/heart disease, a nd problems with mob ility (arthritis). 
  
 
  
This palace is concerned with your level of inco me, and whether you have to work very hard for 
it or often have "windfall" fortune s. It describes your financial situation in general. This palace 
also indicates how you should make your money, your  wealth luck (whether it is strong or 
weak), and your earning capacity. This chapter will tell you how each of the major stars affects 
this life palace. Zi Wei: You possess power in financial matters a nd can generate wealth in a variety of ways. 
Easy money is likely, but it may be unstable-abun dant one minute and gone the next. Generally, 
you will be well-to-do and will be drawn to careers in finance and money management. 
Tian Fu: You have a tremendous capacity to ge nerate wealth for yourself and for others. You 
could easily find yourself responsible for overs eeing large sums of money. You will have 
significant wealth when this star combines with other favorable financial energies (such as Wu 
Qu). However, if this star is obstructed or pair ed with dark stars, it can reveal legal problems 
surrounding money. 
Wu Qu: The potential for great wealth is presen t with this star/palace combination, as well. Wu 
Qu represents wealth, leadershi p, entrepreneurial skills, handicraf ts, and metals, so it is through 
these channels that financial prosperity will flow . It augers momentous wealth when paired with 
other favorable financial energies (such as Tian Fu) or the wealth catalyst. 
Tian Xiang: Depending on surrounding stars, auspicious financial ev ents come in sets of two. 
However, the same goes for financial setbacks. Karma will determine whether this is a positive 
or negative influence. 
Sha Qi: This powerful energy bestows the ability to take risks. Found pl aced in your wealth 
palace, it encourages taking risks with money, financial speculation, stock trading, and gambling. 
Substantial wealth is possible with Sha Qi, but only if you avoid risky investments. This most 
powerful of the aggressive ma rtial stars indicates disputes  and conflicts brought about by 
earnings. Po Jun: This star (also known as the "destr oyer") in your wealth palace suggests that money 
comes and goes and that you may have difficu lty saving. Investment in new projects or 
businesses will be successf ul; however, money is not stable and you will need to learn to manage 
it carefully and frugally. On a more positive note,  you are an exceedingly resourceful individual 
when it comes to creative ways to make a fortune. 
Lian Zhen: You deal with financial matters w ith blood relatives, and these dealings are kept 
confidential. Trust accounts and inheritances occur frequently with this placement, as well. 
Wealth is generated through struggle, competition, and controversy. 
Tan Lang: You love money, but also love ga mbling, excitement, and risk. Money from the 
opposite sex comes to you easily. There is the possibi lity of quick money or unexpected financial 
windfalls. People of the opposite sex affect your money either positively or negatively, 
depending on the other stars present in this palace . With negative energies , money is lost through 
gambling or bankruptcy. 
T'ai Yang: With the sun in your wealth palace, there is no problem getting money to flow in; the 
problem is keeping it. With this extravagant en ergy, you like to spend rather than save. The more 
you make, the more you want to spend, and this ma y be motivated by a desire for status and an 
affluent appearance. You coul d incur debt due to others. Ju Men: Wealth is generated by way of your voi ce or communication skills. If this star is 
surrounded by other positive energies, it gives the gi ft of oration or public speaking. If it is 
obstructed or joined by negative stars, it suggests th at wealth is blocked by slander, misspeaking, 
gossip, or financial litigation. 
Tian Ji: Due to Tian Ji's unstable and inconsistent nature, this is not an au spicious star to find in 
your wealth palace. Money comes and goes, but it s flow is sufficient for your needs. You will 
earn your wealth working by yourself or in solo e fforts. You learn quickly and are an excellent 
negotiator. 
T'ai Yin: The moon in your wealth palace indi cates the potential for a limitless fortune. Calm, 
composed, and clever, you have a natural talent for tucking away a nest egg and accumulating 
savings for future security. Compounded funds that may be hidden will be your primary source 
of fortune. You accumulate wealth quietly and without fanfare. 
Tian Tong: With this star in your wealth palace, you will be content wi th whatever level of 
financial prosperity you attain. Always happy to le t others shine, you will not gain financially at 
the expense of others. It is because of this kind and altruistic attitude that fortune will shine upon 
you. You have the ability to start your own bus iness from scratch and will be financially 
comfortable in old age. 
Tian Liang: This problem-solving energy attracts tribulations and then proceeds to solve them. 
Unfortunately, bad times must be experienced befo re a change for the better. Tian Liang placed 
in your wealth palace indicates that you may be in a constant  process of solving financial 
troubles. Greater effort is required in order to straighten out money issu es. Disputes and unrest 
are brought about by earnings, inheri tance, trust funds, or winnings. 
  
 
  
The children palace reveals the relationship w ith your children, your subordinates, and your 
students. It also represents the quality of your idea s (brainchildren), projects, and creative efforts. 
In this chapter, you will learn how each of the major star energies affects this important life 
palace. Zi Wei: Finding the Zi Wei star in this palace su ggests that you will have few children and that it 
will be more favorable for you to have them later in life. This star reve als active and intelligent 
offspring-more females than males, although bo ys may come along later on. Your children are 
strong and confident, but difficult to control because of th eir strong wills. 
Tian Fu: This star in your children palace i ndicates that you will have  many children. You will 
forge a good relationship with them and will have a strong influence on their lives. You enjoy a 
filial and stable bond with your offspring as well  as with your employees, if you are a manager 
or business owner. 
Wu Qu: You will have few offspring, and more than likely they will be with your second spouse. 
Wu Qu in this palace indicates strong, confiden t children (and senior employees, if in business). 
Your children will be very strong-willed, with minds of their own, and may be a challenge to 
educate. 
Tian Xiang: It will be better for you to have a daughter as a firstborn. This "m irroring" star of 
duplication means that things will come in twos, revealing the possibility of twins or a premature 
birth. This star suggests that you will have obedient, truthful, and sensible children in whose 
lives you will be exceptionally involved. 
Sha Qi: You will have few children, but they wi ll have extremely strong characters and be 
difficult to control. Sha Qi is a risky energy to fi nd in your children palace, as it can be a sign of 
miscarriages, birth defects, or genetic disord ers. Sha Qi suggests th at you will have aloof 
children who will hide what is going on inside of them. They will have many hard lessons to 
learn. Po Jun: Po Jun placed in the children palace indi cates active, rebellious children. The firstborn 
will be the most difficult to raise and may be in poor health as a child. He or she may be scarred, 
born prematurely, or endure some kind of unfort unate setback or blow. When placed in this 
palace, this "demolisher" star unfortunately re veals a difficult or blocked road to pregnancy 
(infertility, miscarriage, abortion). The childre n's relationships with each other may also be 
damaged. Lian Zhen: Your offspring will have logical minds  and enjoy taking things apart to find out how 
they work. They must be very cautious with fi re and electricity. Children and employees will 
tend to be secretive, so it will be imperative to keep an open dialog with them. All in all, you will 
have a positive relationship with your offspring. 
Tan Lang: Finding the "pleasure" star in this pa lace can reveal a child born out of wedlock. You 
will have two or three curious and capricious children who are charming and sociable. They must 
be cautious, however, as this tendency can tu rn into a fondness for partying, drinking, and 
gambling. 
T'ai Yang: This bright and shining influence is a powerful energy to find in your children palace. 
It reveals very active, helpful children and employees who will fi nd themselves in the public eye and will enjoy a certain amount of recognition an d fame. The sun indicates difficult pregnancies 
with possible miscarriage(s)  or therapeutic abortions. 
Ju Men: You will have talkative children with  advanced verbal skills who are nevertheless 
difficult to communicate with. These are sassy, impish offspring who like to talk back and 
challenge your authority. Th ere will be many disagreements between you. When other 
auspicious stars are present, your children will be linguistically gifted. However, if this star carries the obstruction catalyst or is joined by any of the dark stars, the opposite will be true. 
Speech impediments or structural abnormalities of the mouth (harelip, cleft palate) may occur. 
Tian Ji: This is not a pleasant star to find in this palace. Your children are forward-thinking and 
smart, but may face dangers of various kinds. This star brings great risk to the children from 
machines and automobiles. Your offspring (and your best ideas) will come later in life, and there 
will be many challenges with them. T'ai Yin: This feminine yin energy reveals female  offspring and very favorable relationships with 
your children and employees. Your daughters w ill be quiet and introverted, and will enjoy 
financial security. 
Tian Tong: A very favorable rela tionship is in store for you and your  children. At times, the lines 
separating you and them may be blurry, and you could have more of a friendship with them 
rather than an adversarial, parent-child rela tionship. Although your relationship with them will 
be good, their health may be fragile. Tian Liang: This star reveals gentle and supportive children who are intelligent and studious and 
who will care for you in your old age. They will l ove the fine arts and may come along later in 
your marriage. Their maturity will surpass their age. Firstborns are frequently daughters with this 
placement. 
  
 
  
This palace covers all significant romantic attach ments, not just marriage.  It indicates whether 
you will enjoy a happy marriage/ union/relationship or  an adversarial one. It also explains why 
some people marry many times and why some stay single for life. It desc ribes your married life, 
indicates what kind of person your  spouse is, and reveals whether or not your partnership is 
thriving. If there are no stars found in this pa lace, look to its opposite  palace of career for 
guidance. Zi Wei: Your spouse or partner is the domineeri ng boss in your relationship. Although he or she 
can be responsible and a good partner, he/she ma y not meet your emotional needs. Despite this, 
it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for you two to part ways. There may be multiple 
marriages to the same individual. 
Tian Fu: Your spouse is good with the family finances . If the Zi Wei star is also present, it is an 
indication of a second marriage. Your later marri age will be happier than the first, and you will 
share many interests in common with your spouse. This star also suggests that your spouse will 
be conservative, traditional, and guarded. 
Wu Qu: Your spouse or partner will be slight or  short of stature and s hy, yet have a resonant, 
deep voice. He/she may be difficult to comm unicate with; the relationship will suffer from 
bickering, arguments, and internal strife. This is  an inauspicious placement as it generally points 
to a domineering spouse. It will be be tter for you to marry  later on in life. 
Tian Xiang: As matters come in twos with this  star, it is a clear indi cation of more than one 
marriage or significant relationship. There is a good possibility that you will marry an old 
acquaintance, your high sc hool sweetheart, or someone from your home town. 
Sha Qi: This star is no friend to the unions pal ace. It reveals that your spouse has a very strong 
personality and that you will marry him or her s uddenly. This star also re veals that you put up a 
happy front for others that hides an inner discontent or unhappiness with  your relationship. It 
describes your spouse as an independent, silent type who is hard to read. There will be many 
hard lessons to be learned in this palace. 
Po Jun: Because this star is all about "out with the old and in with the ne w," it is disastrous to 
find in your relationship palace.  You and your spouse will have very little in common, and 
divorce is almost certain. There will be at least two marriages, one of which may be unusual in 
some way (marrying a cousin or a brother-/sister-in law, a marri age for citizenship, an arranged 
marriage, and so on). You will have rocky relationshi ps in general, especially early on in life. 
Lian Zhen: Arguing, affairs, and a possible divorce are likely in the stars for you. Your spouse or 
partner may be friendly one minute and pick a fight with you the next. Lian Zhen is an indication 
of a spouse who has emotional problems, bipolar disorder, or other psyc hological disturbances. 
Abundant passion that cannot be co ntained causes relationship problem s. A strong blood factor is 
at play with this star; in the unions palace, it can reveal operations, injuries, and/ or accidents 
involving the spouse or  significant other. 
Tan Lang: This energy of extremes is the main star of sexuality, danger, love, and problems 
connected with love. Wherever it is placed will reveal fights, power struggles, and romantic 
triumphs or painful failures in matters of the heart. Placed here, it represents indulgence, 
sensuality, and the form of th e body (physique). Full of sensua l magnetism, your partner loves 
romance, but this causes tur bulence in your relationship. 
T'ai Yang: Passion can turn cold quickly with Ta i Yang in your relationship palace. With this 
very public and "in the limelight" energy, your spous e will be in the public eye in some way. He or she will have success and popularity and po ssesses an energetic a nd radiant personality. 
Unless it is obstructed or surrounded by dark star s, your spouse/partner will be benevolent, open, 
and elegant. 
Ju Men: This is an argumentative placement. It re veals that your spouse will be talkative, but will 
have very little of substance to say. Communication difficulties cause marital strife, and you will 
constantly be drawn into arguments by your spouse . Ju Men (also called the "gloomy" star) may 
lead to jealousy, slander, and di shonesty. It can also represent lit igation, privacy, and suspicion if 
surrounded by dark stars. 
Tian Ji: Tian Ji reveals a part ner who has an active mind and quick  intelligence. He or she loves 
to learn new things, but may lack perseverance. Ec lectically talented in many trades, he/ she is 
highly intelligent, but unstable. Mu ch traveling with be required of your spouse or partner, and 
this may be a catalyst that ends the relationship. This a very unstable energy to find in the unions 
palace. T'ai Yin: With the moon in your unions palace, y our spouse or partner will be tranquil, graceful, 
and wealthy, and distinguished by literary, spiritu al, reflective, feminine "yin" qualities. Placed 
here it reveals a supportive spouse who is financia lly fortunate or wealthy in his or her own right. 
There may be a significant age diffe rence between you and your partner. 
Tian Tong: This is a beautiful energy to have in your unions palace. It describes your spouse or 
partner as a contented soul who goes through li fe as a happy-go-lucky adolescent. Self-effacing 
and always ready to start anew, he or she is ha ppy to let you shine. This  is a gracious, learned, 
gentle soul who leans toward th e fine arts and spiritual subjects, and will spend much time in 
quiet meditation and self-cultiva tion. He or she is emotional, sensitive, and able to build 
something from nothing. 
Tian Liang: This radiant star ac hieves results with persuasion ra ther than force. Your spouse may 
be much older than you, and brings heirlooms, an estate, or a family business to your union. 
He/she is not one to toil or struggle, and will di splay a certain degree of sophistication as he/ she 
pursues the good, easy life. This star indicates longevity, but also loneliness. Your spouse or 
partner will be principled and orderly, and will be  employed in a career that has to do with the 
elderly, medication, insurance, accounting, mathematics, or the military. 
  
 
  
This palace concerns your relationships with your siblings and p eers. This is where you can look 
to find information on business partners, colleagues,  and fellow students, as well. The strengths 
and weaknesses of your riva ls are also located in this pal ace. Following is how each major star 
will affect this particular life palace. Zi Wei: This star reveals strong and dependable siblings, powerful rivals, and prominent or high-
ranking colleagues. Your siblings are helpful, but you may not get along with them because they 
tend to be bossy or want to be treated like kings . You will have two or three siblings, and they 
will tend to overshadow you or  be more successful. 
Tian Fu: This star reveals multiple siblings w ho are of some assistance, but not much support. 
These siblings may be favored by the parents. Bu siness associates and rivals will see failures, 
and the favored siblings could end up disappointi ng the parents. All in al l, you will experience a 
harmonious relationship with your siblings and working partners. 
Wu Qu: This star reveals few but strong a nd opinionated siblings who have commanding 
personalities. You will experience disharmony and disagreements with them. Business associates 
will be direct and straightforward, difficult to d eal with at times, but able to produce swift and 
effective results. Tian Xiang: This star placed in your siblings palace indicates many siblings and is generally 
quite favorable unless the obstructio n catalyst is attached or it is  accompanied by dark stars. You 
will have many siblings, and amongst them there will be similar personalities or even twins. The 
"mirror" star placed here reveals reunions with associates from your past who become your 
business partners. 
Sha Qi: This martial, fighti ng star indicates disharmony w ith, petty jealousies among, and 
conflicts with a small number of siblings. They  will be unable to communicate with you, and you 
may feel very distant from them. This star in your siblings palace reveals some challenging times 
and hard life lessons for them. Po Jun: The oldest sibling will carry the heaviest  burden with this aggressive martial star. There 
will be illnesses and possibly a wide age gap between  siblings. This is a family of hottempered 
rebels, and you will find yourself assuming a lot of  responsibility early in life. This placement 
does not bode well for relationships between you a nd your fellow students, working partners, or 
rivals. Battles may become bitter and relationships destroyed. Lian Zhen: This changeable star indicates si blings who are sometimes helpful and sometimes 
not. Business partners will have tricks up th eir sleeves and could undermine you. Lian Zhen 
represents blood and death, so you could lose a sibling at an early age. Sometimes this is through 
divorce or adoption, however. 
Tan Lang: You should have harmonious relationships, but be wary of siblings or work associates 
who feel that they have an unquestionable right  to your possessions or property. You will get 
along better with your siblings if you live separately; otherwise you could have difficult 
relationships. This is also an indication of half-siblings, step -siblings, or a blended family. 
T'ai Yang: This masculine energy points to brothe rs or male relatives w ho are significant in your 
life. Siblings or business associates will achieve  success and be in the public eye in some way. 
When the obstruction catalyst is attached to the sun, it veils its energy; this  should caution you 
regarding unscrupulous employ ees, male business associates , and/or men in general. Ju Men: You must be wary of siblings, peer s, or work colleagues engaging in slander, 
disagreements, and gossip. Unfavorable relationshi ps with siblings are often found with this 
placement. Ju Men brings problems and misunders tandings due to miscommunication or verbal 
abuse. 
Tian Ji: Your siblings will be on the move and will tend to come and go in and out of the family 
circle. You may fall victim to  some behind-the-scenes sche ming on their part, underhanded 
trickery on the part of your bus iness associates, or fast-talking  con men who are here today and 
gone tomorrow. You will have few siblings, and you will have more sisters than brothers. They 
are all intelligent, but there may be arguments between them. Tian Ji is also a sign of a blended 
family or siblings from different parentage. T'ai Yin: This feminine energy indicates that you will have sisters. When reflected from the 
opposite palace of friends, however, it indicates a female friend who will be as close as a sister. 
This star is an indication of ge ntle siblings who are financially  well-off and advantageous for you 
to associate with. 
Tian Tong: This star reveals talented, peaceful, and fun-loving siblings with whom you may be 
close friends. They are relaxed lovers of life and happy to let you shine. Siblings and business 
partners are emotional, sensitive, and able to  build exciting projects fr om almost nothing. They 
may make a living in a career that has something to  do with leisure, entert ainment, or recreation. 
Tian Liang: This star in your siblings palace indicates that you will take care of your younger 
siblings as a parent would and that you will ha ve favorable relationships with them. You may 
have many siblings, and there c ould be significant age differences  between you. This star also 
reveals that one of them may leave you an inheritance. In business, Tian Liang indicates older 
partners who pass down a legac y, a practice, or a business. 
  
 
  
In Chapter 13, we learned that the focal point of a Zi Wei Dou Shu chart is the destiny palace, or 
ming gong. You also learned about the 14 major stars (the ming gong zhu xin, or "main life 
stars") and how they affect your  life path. You also found out wh ich soul group (royal, martial, 
or psycho-social/litera ry) you are a part of. 
 And write down which of the 12 animal signs occupies your destiny palace:  
Again, the emperor, vault, commander, and prime minister stars are the most beneficial ones of 
Chinese astrology. Where they are placed will be the most powerful and protected areas of your life chart. The seven swords, Aphrodite, crims on passion, and the demolisher stars are the most 
aggressive and complicated ones of Chinese astrology. Where they are placed there will be 
fighting, difficulties, and power struggles. 
Next, notice where the four transforming catalysts  are found in your chart and write down which 
star(s) they are attached to: 
 
After examining your self/destiny pa lace, look to your karmic luck palace to establish a complete 
character profile. The basic equa tion is self/destiny palace + karmic luck palace = personality. 
Each palace in your chart also represents a spec ific decade. The age at which the decade transit 
occurs is in the top right-hand box of each life palace. Start in your self/destiny palace and move 
through your chart, decade by decade, to see the va rious influences. Notice which palaces are in 
trine (separated by three palaces) with the others, thereby combining their energies. For example, to analyze wealth, look to the self and career palaces. 
Forecasting 
In addition to the Chinese natal chart, which is fi xed for life, there is a mobile (moving) part of 
your chart-a 10-year cycle (in blue on the accomp anying CD) and an annual or yearly cycle (in 
red on the CD). Each of these energies moves to  a new position in one's chart each year. The 
decade (in blue) and yearly (in red) cycles are me rely smaller cycles contained within the larger 
life cycles. These "transits" come back regularly to the positions they originally occupied at 
birth. They reactivate the potenti alities of the life pa lace they pass through. They also raise 
obstacles or urge us to iron out  difficulties. By observing which life palace is transiting over your 
self palace each year, as well as  where the four catalysts come to  rest, you will shine light on that 
year's forecasts. When I was trying to decide what birth chart to  use as an interpretive example for this book, I 
toyed with several ideas before finally settling upon the unlucky s oul I would put on the hot seat. 
After lending my analysis to thousands of charts  over the years, I found it only fair to put the 
scrutiny on me-the good, the bad, and the ugly.  
Having no major stars in the self palace is indicativ e of a late bloomer who doesn't come into his 
or her own until midlife. This person may also feel  emptiness and frustration. This is true in my 
case. When none of the 14 major stars are present,  then, we must borrow stars from the palace 
directly opposite the self/destiny palace; these become the resident energies of both palaces. This 
will be the case with any empty life palace or one that contains only minor energies. So we must 
look to my travel palace to find the major destiny energies. 
Present in this palace are two major stars, Wu Qu and Tan Lang. Wu Qu is a major energy in the 
imperial or ruling group and reveal s a soul blessed by birth to lea d, to protect, and to be a key 
figure in this life in some way. Wu Qu is sometimes called the "military minister" due to the 
speed and quick thinking it contributes. It repres ents a decisive leader who figuratively leads his 
or her army into battle. It is a quick, intense, and temperamental energy-the astral signature of an 
individual who feels the need to  lead in some type of public service. This person is likely 
involved in the nuts and bolts of planning and putting ideas to wor k. The commander star is also 
responsible for entreprene urial skills, and reveals a destiny of one who is the "right hand man" to 
the powerful and influential. Its presence indicates a strong and resilient personality as well as a 
competitive spirit; women in particular are genera lly very comfortable with and competitive in 
the company of males. It indicates good luck, bu t also solitude, firmness,  and even stubbornness. 
Indeed, this is all very true for me. I am stubborn and tenacious, and I prefer to give orders rather 
than take them. This star energy also allows me  to get a large amount of work done in a small 
amount of time when necessary. I am also an in dependent and impatient person who tends to act 
too quickly. 
Aphrodite (Tan Lang) is a major "peach blossom" energy and the most powerful star of pleasure 
and romance. Those with Tan Lang in their de stiny palace are eloquent, love to entertain 
lavishly, and possess exceptional people skills. This star's energy is all about making strong 
connections with others. This is  an indulgent energy of sensualit y, physical love, socializing, and enjoyment; it has the ability to captivate the oppo site sex. Unfortunately, it is also the main 
culprit responsible for my unrelenting love life  dramas. Romance and sensuality cause trouble 
with Tan Lang in the self/destiny palace, and I am resigned to th e fact that love and all its 
attendant problems will be the tumultuous common denominator of my existence. 
On a different note, metaphysics, religion, spirituality, and free thinking also characterize those 
with Tan Lang in their destiny palace, as does a strongly empathic nature. People with this 
placement often pursue astrology, divination, or other spiritual arts. This has certainly been true 
in my case. Lian Zhen in my karma palace combin ed with the Aphrodite st ar in my self palace, 
reveals an artistic personality. Moreover, the comb ination of Tian Yue in my self/destiny palace 
and Tian Kui opposite it symbolizes the pen. Th is literary, writing ener gy, combined with the 
next batch of stars present, begins to build a more complete picture. 
Tian Fu in my career palace, Tian Xiang in my wealth palace, Wu Qu a nd Tan Lang in the travel 
palace, and Wen Qu in my karma palace all rev eal a housewife turned en trepreneur. According 
to the chart, this happened between the ages of 46 and 55. Indeed, I didn't start my writing career 
until this time. 
To take a glimpse at the bad news, notice the obstruc tion catalyst (solid square block) attached to 
the fast-moving energy of Tian Ji in my childre n palace. Tian Ji has to do with machines, 
automobiles, fast movement, and impediments to  strategy or movement. The additional presence 
of the two dark stars, Tuo Luo and Di Jie, in  the children palace added strength to an already 
risky situation. Unfortunately, real ity bore this out as true, as well. The fateful day happened on a 
hot August afternoon in 1988. My only son was hit and almost killed by a reckless driver who 
was obliviously speeding down our  quiet residential neighbor hood street. Fortunately, after 
enduring a painful recovery with the help of his doctors, he has grown into a fine young man. 
After all, he was born into a year of the resi lient, enduring Ox? More  mundanely, my health 
palace contains Tai Yang, the sun, which reveals a weakness in my eyesight. I am, in fact, so 
myopic and nearsighted that my op tical prescription requires what  I call "the creature that ate 
Tokyo" glasses. I am completely depende nt on these glasses or contact lenses. 
In Zi Wei astrology, just as in life, we have to  take the good with the bad. This system can give 
you insight into what is likely to happen if you ta ke a certain course of act ion. It can be a useful 
tool to advise you on the best c ourse of action to take in orde r to achieve the ends you desire. 
Once you learn the essence of each of the various stars and life palaces, you will begin to put 
together a comprehensive astral profile of your fate and destiny and how you fit into the 
universe. 
  
 
  
  
 
  
The I-Ching, or Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese process of  divination that dates back to 
about 3,000 BCE. However, it may have  been in use even thousands of years earlier by Siberian 
shamans, who used cracked tortoise shells as  their method of divini ng the future. The IChing 
represents one of the first efforts of humanity to understand its place with in the universe. Later, 
when it became a book, it provided a common so urce of wisdom for both Confucianism and 
Taoist philosophies. To many We sterners, the I-Ching seems mysterious and obscure, not to mention incredibly complex. Yet it's treasured by m illions in the East as a valued oracle and tool 
for divination. 
How can something that's thousands of years ol d be effective in a modern society? Those 
consulting the I-Ching may use it for advice in ev eryday decisions and for spiritual guidance. It 
can also be used in path-working, rituals, and opening astral doorways. The I-Ching is actually a 
simple binary system of zeros and ones, simila r to the language of modem computers. In this 
system, broken and solid lines are grouped into hexagrams. Each hexagram is generated line by 
line, and contains a unique arra ngement of six lines. There are a total of 64 hexagrams. 
In divination, each line has a special meaning based on its placement in the hexagram, which is 
read from the bottom up. The patterns,  or oracles, reveal the answer  or answers to the question or 
problem at hand. Coins, sticks, cards, stones, or the traditional yarrow stalks can be used, but 
always in threes. These items are tossed into th e air, and the numerological total will determine 
the type of line in the hexagram, which is built from the base upward. A que stion is best phrased 
in a "yes or no" form, although it need not be sp oken nor written. This process is repeated until 
the six lines are built. Today, ther e are extensive interpretations that can be brought to bear on 
this method: Confucian, Taoist, feminist Goddess , and the list goes on. Because of free will, the 
I-Ching only hints at the future and does not actu ally delineate it. Real magic works from the 
inside out, and self-knowledge is  an absolute necessity to avoid falling into the snares of self-
delusion. Here are the 64 hexagrams of the I-Ching in order:

The traditional manner of consulting the I-Ching was to toss up a bundle of yarrow sticks or 
coins with holes in the center over and over ag ain in a very long and ri tualistic process. The 
modern equivalent would be th e three coin method, in which th ree coins are thrown six times. 
When the coins land, the combination of odd or ev en sides (head or tails ) yields a particular 
result, called a "line." The line can either be an unbroken horizontal line, or  a horizontal line with 
a break in the center. In I-Ching, each throw generates one line in the hexagram, starting from 
the bottom and working upward. 
Each side of the coin is given a numerical valu e: "heads" counts as tw o, and "tails" counts as 
three. The total is then added to give a score. So three coins that land as "heads" would give a 
score of six; three coins landing as "tails" would give a score of  nine; and one coin landing as 
"heads" and the other two coins landing as "tails" yields a score of eight; and so on. Any even 
score yields a broken line, while an odd score yiel ds a solid line. And fina lly, any score of 6 or 9 
yields what is called a "changing" or "moving" line, which will invert the final result. For 
example: O 3 heads = 6 = a broken line (-----) whic h changes to a firm line (------). 
O 3 tails = 9 = a firm line (------) which changes to a broken line (-----). O 2 heads and 1 tail = 7 = a firm  line (------) that does not change. 
O 2 tails and 1 head = 8 = a broken line (----- ) that  does not change. Depending on the answer you receive, you can try di fferent approaches to the same question. 
You may frame it slightly differently , clarify it, or alter it entirely. 
The I-Ching is a wonderful means of making deci sions and thinking out th e finer points of any 
situation. If you would like to expl ore this subspecialty of Chinese astrology further, there are a 
myriad of resources av ailable to you in bookstore s and on the Internet. 
  
 
  
Feng shui (literally, "wind and water") was first practiced in China 3,000 years ago and became 
an official state science. In ancient China, wind and water were the strongest known natural 
forces. If you were to imagine an invisible st ream of energy moving over your head like the 
wind, that would be feng. Shui is represented by the water in the earth, such as an underground 
stream. Feng shui is the historic  discipline of manipula ting the invisible and subtle energies of 
the cosmos (qi) to create harmony between peopl e and their environment. The essence of feng shui is that an indivi dual or business can, by pr oper orientation of a hous e or office according to 
these ancient principles, attract favorable cosmic  influences. One way to do this is by using the 
colors of the five creative elem ents: green (Wood), red (Fire), yell ow (Earth), white (Metal), and 
black (Water). According to fe ng shui theory, you would incorporate these colors in the 
appropriate area in the form of furniture, rugs , bedspreads, decorative items, and so on. Today, 
feng shui practitioners ply their trade throughout the world, but in no place are they more revered 
than in Hong Kong, where it is rare that a building is planned without the advice of a feng shui 
master. 
The theory of the five elements is the f oundation of feng shui. How you should use them is 
determined by your Chinese astrological birth chart. A feng shui practitioner can tell you: 
1. Your best sleeping directions. 
2. Your best work (sittin g at a desk) directions. 
3. Your best area for creativity, st udying, and practicing a discipline. 
4. Your "good entrance direction, " which brings luck and supportive people into  your life. 
5. Your "bad entrance direction," which can drain you or make it difficult to save money. 
6. How to attract love possibi lities using a romance remedy. 
Feng shui is not magic, however; rather, it allo ws us to live in harmony with our environment. 
Cosmic energy (qi), also called ear th luck, is different from heav en luck (which is the destiny 
that is readable in the various as trological charts) and man luck (w hat we make of our life). Qi is 
the same energy that the yogis call prana, that the ancient alchemists tried to capture, that 
acupuncture regulates, and that Eastern martial arts (karate, tai-chi-chuan, qigong) use. It's also 
the same cosmic energy that is used in holistic medicine-reiki, for example. Some also compare 
it to the Holy Spirit that falls upon Christians in  tongues of flame during the Pentecost. There is 
both good qi (sheng qi) and bad qi (sha qi). 
Feng shui diagnoses the status of a home and proposes possible solutions, or  "cures," to improve 
the situation. A feng shui pr actitioner will stand in front of your home and determine its 
orientation or direction with a sp ecial compass called a lo pan. Th e practitioner will then look at 
the important areas of your floor plan (bedrooms, entrances, offices) to determine what annual 
energy exits there. You will be advised of your  home's most prosperous areas and how to 
enhance them. You will also be told of any impo rtant areas that may be prone to accidents, 
arguments, lawsuits, loneliness, setbacks, or dela ys, and how to reduce these negative influences. 
Careful observation of the surroundings of the home is also involved. Hills, mountains, creeks, 
pools, other buildings, and domina nt winds are noted. This inform ation is combined with the 
birth data of the inhabitants and the date the home was built to determine a master plan. Your natal Zi Wei Dou Shu chart can also be used to  supplement the feng shui cures. Each of the 12 
life palaces are associated with a cardinal direction, which may or may not be favorable for you. For example, if the palace that contains the sign of the Rat (corresponding to the North) is mainly 
occupied by favorable energies, then the Northern  direction is favorable for you. However, even 
if your astrological chart is auspicious, there will always be periods of vulnerability when misfortune can step in if the environment allows  it. According to the old Chinese masters, living 
in a malefic house can usher in catastrophes such as injuries, fires, floods, accidents, robberies, 
adulteries, divorces, illn esses, and bankruptcies. 
Creating a Feng Shui Garden 
A garden is a place you can go to relax, to unwin d, and to connect with the earth. Using the 
principles of feng shui, you can create an unique, private retreat where you can go to escape the 
fast-paced world, to dream, and to reflect. Feng shui gardens are about putting everything in their 
proper place. Of course, spring is the perfect season to plan and create a feng shui garden, but the 
winter months can be a great tim e to do the planning and designing. 
When planning your garden, there are some pr inciples you should keep in mind. Beneficial 
energy flow is created with wavy or curvy shapes and lines, whereas negative energy is generated by sharp, straight, or angular lines (called "poison a rrows"). Create a balance of yin 
(dark, soft, passive) and yang (light , hard, active) plants, objects,  and water. And keep in mind 
the producing/ generating and controlling/destructiv e relationships between the five elements of 
Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Stand in  the center of your outdoor space and use a 
compass to determine the eight directions. Then, refer to the following guide to place the colors, 
symbols, numbers, and elements  in their appropriate areas.

Palmistry came to China around 3,000 BC. Palmis try is the art of ch aracter reading and 
foretelling the future through the study of the palm.  There are several branch es of this particular 
art. Chiromancy is the study of the lines on the palm. These lines are formed during fetal 
development and are the best indicators of person ality traits and characters. This was palmistry 
in ancient times. Later the various marks and mounts on the palm were also examined. 
Chirognomy is the study of the general shape and texture of the hand, fingers, and fingernails. Dermatoglyphics is the study of the ridges of the fingertips (fingerpri nts). Nowadays this is used 
as a personal identification tool and in criminal/forensic sciences. 
 
The palm lines  
The life line 
This line symbolizes how vigorous you are as well as your enthusiasm for living. If it is long and 
defined, you have great potential and a sense of adventure.  
The head line 
This is an indicator of how you use your intell igence. A strong line indicates that you think 
before acting. Some breaks represen t lack of focus. The slope of the line is associated with 
creativity.  
The heart line 
The heart line represents your emotions and healt h. When this line is straight, the emotions are 
ruled by the mind, and sentimentality  is mixed with good instincts.  
The fate line 
A strong line indicates balance and strength. Breaks in the line could mean that major changes 
will affect your life.  
The sun line 
The sun line on your palm relates to luck, success and fortune. A long vertical sun line indicates 
a lucky life with many blessings. A blurred line suggests a lack of focus. A hard worker's line 
curves toward the thumb.  
The health line 
The health line (also known as the Mercury line) s hows vitality and important life changes. It can 
also indicate an intuitive nature. No discernabl e health line means a lifetime of good health. A 
health line crossing the life line suggests ill health and inheri ted diseases. A wavy line suggests 
digestive problems, and a blurred line shows a lack of stamina.  
The bracelets 
The stronger and more defined the bracelets are, the better your general health is likely to be. 
The Life Line 
The life line does not indicate how l ong you will live; rather, it reveal s the quality of your life. It 
is an index of how much vitality, strength, and energy you will have. A lif e line running close to 
the thumb indicates a person of low vitality. It is sometimes found on the hands of people who 
suffer chronic fatigue syndrome. A life line that makes a wide curve shows a person with a great 
deal of vitality and get up and go. If the head line is stronger than the life line, this shows a 
person who is more mentally than  physically active. A chained lif e line indicates delicate health. 
Little lines rising indicate an active personality. Outward swinging lines indi cate a love of travel. 
Most of the small lines on the life line refer to particular events at cer tain times in your life. If your life line: 
O Runs close to your thumb, you have low vitality and are often tired. 
O Has a wide curve, you have high vitality and lots of energy. O Is bigger or wider than your head line, you are more active physically than mentally. 
O Is chained, you have weak health. 
O Has small rising lines, you ha ve an active personality. 
O Has outward-swinging lines, you love to travel. 
The Head Line The head line represents the way you think, not n ecessarily how smart you are. It concerns the 
mental processes, as well as willpower and ment al fortitude. The head line is the prominent line 
below the heart line. An average head line ends  somewhere under the ring finger. A short head 
line indicates a person whose thinking is simple  and straight to the point. A long head line 
indicates a person who thinks things through very carefully. A straight head line indicates clear, 
concentrated thinking. A curved head line belongs to a person who likes to play with new ideas. 
Sloping head lines belong to creative people. Hori zontal head lines bel ong to people who look at 
the practical side of life. Chained head lines belong to highly strung people. A fork in the 
headline shows the ability to see more than one po int of view. A floating h ead line is indicative 
of someone with a carefree attitude. A head line that starts under the index finger indicates a 
brilliant mind. 
If your head line: 
O Ends around your ring finger, your head line is average. 
O Is short, you think simply and directly. 
O Is long, you're a thorough and careful thinker. 
O Is straight, you think clearly and are able to concentrate. 
O Is curved, you are ready to play with new and different ideas. 
O Is sloped, you're a creative thinker. 
O Is horizontal, you thin k in practical terms. 
O Makes a chain-like pattern, you are strung-out. O Has a fork in it, you are open-minded and capable of seeing many points of view. 
O Floats (is disconnected), you have a carefree attitude. 
O Starts under the index finger, you are brilliant! 
The Heart Line 
The heart line reflects the emotional side of your  personality and relates to all matters of the 
heart. The heart line is not just a way of telling what will happen, but also a way of finding out 
why things happen. Imagine two heart lines extending from the edge of the hand below the little 
finger to between the first and second fingers. The first line is a deep curve while the second 
heart line is straighter. The curved line is activ e in romantic matters, while the straight line is 
passive. The curved heart line is aggressive in love, whereas the straight one is receptive. The 
curved heart line is demonstrative, while the strai ght line thinks about it. Interestingly, the curved 
line is much more common on male hands, and th e straight line is more common on female 
hands. A heart line that becomes a steep curve below the index and middle fingers indicates 
someone who has a strong sexual desire. If th e heart line ends up under the index finger, it 
indicates someone who is choos y about his or her partner. 
If your heart line: 
O Curves steeply under the index and middle finger, th ere's strong sexual desire. 
O Ends under the index finger, you're picky with your lovers. 
O Ends under the middle finger (this is rare), you may feel lonely or deprived of love. 
O Is straight and short, you have no n eed for romance, but a strong sex drive. 
O Has two or more lines branching off, this show s the number of sides to your emotional nature. 
O Points downward with a branch and touche s the life line, you're easily hurt in love. 
O Is the same as your partner, you will have a successful union or marriage. 
The Fate Line 
The fate line (also called the destiny line) i ndicates the influence the world will have on you. 
Strong fate lines belong to people who settle into a pattern of life early. Weak fate lines tend to 
belong to people who are unsettled and tend to change  jobs a lot. Fate lines starting at the very 
bottom of the palm indicate people who settle into their life path ea rly. When the fate line ends at 
the head line, it indicates a person who seems to  lose his or her way somewhere between 30 and 
40 years of age. Most fate lines end at the heart line. However, if  the fate line runs all the way up 
almost to the middle finger, this person will tend to be active right up into old age. A fate line 
that is tied to the heart line indicates a re stricted childhood. Two fate lines are found on people who pursue two careers at the same  time. The absence of a fate line indicates a person who lacks 
stability. It is also found on the ha nds of alcoholics and drug addicts. 
Palm readers also look at other lines and marks on the palm-for example, the ring of Solomon 
around the forefinger, the girdle of Venus above th e heart line, the bracel et lines on the wrist, 
relationship lines under the little finger the fate li ne from the wrist to the middle finger, the sun 
line from the wrist to the ring finger, and so  on. Again, all the lines are read to produce a 
complete reading. 
Other Means of Interpretation 
For a palm reader, the length of the fingers indicates information about the individual's character. 
Here's a synopsis: 
O Long fingers: analytical, academ ic, likes attention to detail. 
O Short fingers: practical, intuitive, and instinctive. 
O Proportionate hands: balanced personality. 
Texture is important on both th e back and front of the hand. Softness means sensitivity and 
refinement, while a rough hand shows a coarse nature. Of course, calluses mean the person 
works hard using his or her hands. Flexibility of  the hands and fingers directly represents how 
flexible and easygoing the person is. The length of nails is also im portant. Longer nails that taper 
at the tip mean creativ ity, while square nails mean orderliness. Color indicates how blood 
circulates through the client's body. A pinkish ha nd means he or she is healthy, while yellow 
means too much bile is being produced. Blue me ans there is a circulation problem. The "mounts" 
at the bases of the fingers are also significant: O The Mount of Jupiter (base of the index finge r) shows ambition, leadership, religion, and love 
for nature. 
O The Mount of Saturn (base of the second fi nger) denotes seriousness, wisdom, balance, and 
sadness. 
O The Mount of Apollo (base of the ring finger) represents brilliance, ar tistry, happiness, and 
success. 
O The Mount of Mercury (base of the fourth finger) shows industriousness and shrewdness. 
O The Mount of Venus (base of the thumb) means love, sympathy, music, and passion. 
O The Mount of the Moon (edge of the hand) shows imagination, coldness, and selfishness. 
O The Plain of Mars (the rest of the hand)  denotes courage, bravery, and aggression.

Although you are cultured and bright, you must  shine on your own and rely on your own 
accomplishments. Old age brings a comfortable retirement and wealth. 
If you were born under the Emperor's Knees: This difficult placement means that your efforts tend to be fruitless, frustrating, or without 
reward. This is the astral signature of the wa nderer who travels on life's roads. You will have a 
lifetime of hard work and la bor, especially during your middl e-age years. Although youth and 
middle age are arduous, old age is smooth and you will not want for food, shelter, or honor. 
If you were born under the Emperor's Feet: 
This position represents a lifetime of travel, difficult beginnings and endings, and many changes. 
Difficult interpersonal relationships are found in this position, a nd there may be more than one 
marriage. Partnerships after middle age are th e most harmonious, and retirement is pleasant. 
If you were born under the Emperor's Knees or Feet, there is no need to worry as this does not 
mean that you are destined to a life of poverty or squalor. 
  
 
  
9 Star Ki (ki is the Japanese equivalent of the Chinese qi) is one of the most ancient forms of 
divination. This astrological sy stem is based upon the principles of Chinese and Japanese 
astrology and philosophy, the trigra ms from the Yi-Jing (I-Ching), and the principles of yin and 
yang. 9 Star Ki astrology is cente red on your principal 9 Star Ki number, which has its basis in 
the feng shui magic square, or lo-shu. This anci ent tool has been in use for more than 5,000 
years. An important underlying as sumption in 9 Star Ki astrology is  that the universe is full of energy that flows around and through everyone. This  energy works in nine stages, and each cycle 
or stage has its own unique quality. The cycles rep eat themselves in the same order every 9 days, 
every 9 months, every 9 years, and every 81 year s (9 multiplied by 9). We acquire the ki energy 
of whatever cycle we are born into. By using the 9 Star Ki astrological system, we can determine 
our position in the lo-shu matr ix at birth and throughout life, and derive valuable insights 
regarding our personal qualities,  relationships, and destiny. 
To calculate your first (annual) 9 Star Ki number,  add all four numbers of the year you were 
born, reduce the number to one digit, and deduct the result from 11. Here are some examples: 
 
If the outcome is 5, men adopt the number 2 and women adopt the number 8. Number 5 belongs 
to the center and does not have a trigram. 9 Star  Years begin on February 4 of each year, so if 
you were born prior to February 4, use the ki numb er that is assigned to the previous year. For 
example, someone born on January 8, 1953 would use the birth year of 1952, and someone born 
on February 1, 1972 would use the previous ye ar of 1971 for his or her calculations. 
 
According to 9 Star Ki, and just as in tr aditional Chinese lunar astrology, we embody the 
characteristics of the year in which we were bor n. There are nine distin ct personality types. 
i Water 
To fully appreciate the qualities of the 1 Water star, we must look at the qualities of water as it is 
found in nature. On the one hand, you have the liv ely, brisk mountain str eams and waterfalls; on 
the other, you have deep, slow, calm ponds, lakes,  and oceans. 1 Water people tend to fall into 
one or the other of these categories. The spirite d, youthful nature of a fresh mountain stream 
brings out a spirit of advent ure. Water does not have its own shape and needs something to 
contain it; without this containment, there is chaos and destruction. Likewise, 1 Water people can 
be chaotic and undisciplined. However, the opposite can also hold true: From time to time, the 1 
Water can seem too disciplined and rigid. The sens itive, philosophical, and in tuitive side of this 
sign can be seen in the many artists, writers , and composers who were born under it. This 
brooding, reflective quality is sim ilar to the energy of deep wa ter. The trigram k'an, which 
represents the middle son, brings out a diplomatic quality in some  1 Water stars. If you are a 1 
Water, you would make a good arbitr ator or lawyer, and a good listener in general within your 
family and community. Although you may seem quiet on the surface, you he ar all sides of the 
argument and will often come up with a win-win situation. People born as 1 Waters are the 
deepest thinkers within the 9 Star Ki astrology system, and ar e perhaps the most intense and 
spiritual, as well. They generally find liste ning easy, and written communication comes naturally 
to them. 
1 Water people are also very insightful. As the most "yang" of the numbers, they are generally 
very comfortable engaged in worldly pursuits, but they are strongly attracted to the yin, spiritual aspects of life, too. This combination gives 1 Water people very strong intuition. Evolved 1 
Waters seek out people, religions, books-anything, really-that will provide st ructure in their life. 
This inherent drive for structure is not the result of weakness; on the contrary, this personality is 
strong and flexible and, like water, can "flow" in  virtually any direction. Therefore the search is 
for definition, not pampering or restraint. 1 Waters  are also very interested in observing others 
and in romantic relationships. Although they keep  their thoughts and feelings well-hidden, they 
have a deep respect for communication. 
2. 5011 There is a maternal quality that  2 Soil individuals possess when they are in service to others. 
They are not natural-born leaders, but work quiet ly in the background to get the job done. It is 
good to have a 2 Soil around when there is work to  be done; for steadiness and reliability, this 
sign is unbeatable. They are consis tent, steadfast, and very suppor tive. However, they should not 
be mistaken for blind followers. They have strong ideals and are extremely public-minded. The 
quality of soil represented here could be de scribed as earthy loam or compost, which 
encapsulates its nurturing, helpful nature. The eart hy, maternal nature of a 2 Soil is expressed not 
only within the family but also within the larger  family of humanity, as well. There have been 
many examples throughout history of 2 Soil leaders whose main goal was to serve others-for 
example, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Tenzin Gyatso (the Dalai Lama), to name a few. 2 Soils are also gentle and have a str ong, patient quality. They are generally sociable, 
hardworking, and publicspirited, and make excellent teachers or organizers. Busying themselves by helping others gives them great satisfaction. They need to be with in a group; without the 
support of an organization, they can lose directio n and spirit. They tend to  be over-fastidious and 
fussy in their working methods, which can cause them to get bogged down in  detail and irritate 
others. On the plus side, they de rive great strength from using th eir natural talent for diplomacy. 
They feel more at home on the land or in the woods. Gardening or walking in the country are good forms of recreation for them. Because 2 Soils play such a supportive role, they sometimes 
find it difficult to say no to the requests and demands  of others, even when they would rather be 
alone or away from the action. It is advisable th at they make quiet time for rejuvenation. They 
find it difficult to hide from the activities of the world for too long, though, due  to their thirst for 
social interaction. They are not the "get rich quick" type; rather , they can find great prosperity 
through sustained, steady effort. 
3 Tree 3 Trees are born with the full for ce of springtime within their s ouls. Like the season, they are 
endowed with plenty of vitality  and energy and are capable of strong, powerful action. They are 
very positive and optimistic, going about their ta sks vigorously and expecting others to keep up. 
In their pursuit of growth or new pastures, they  tend to lead the way and leave the details to 
others. People who dislike change and interr uption may dislike the vigorous and optimistic 
nature of the 3 Tree. They are open and honest, and can be candidly frank to the point that they 
alienate friends and colleagues. Only after they get their point of view across first will they listen to the thoughts and opinions of others. These st rongly opinionated people  can have grandiose 
ideas, but if they can work with others who can stabilize their visions, they can be extremely 
creative people. As the eldest son of the 9 Star family, 3 Trees are likely to be precocious. Many born under this sign have success early in their lives  and move on as soon as they become bored. 
The full energy of spring that the sign represents also gives 3 Trees a strong, virile nature. 
Celebrities born under this sign are often regarded  as heartthrobs or sex symbols. 3 Trees are 
humorous and outspoken, but frequently get them selves into trouble th rough their direct and 
honest sense of humor. Fortunate ly, their eloquence can just as easily get them out of awkward 
situations. Spontaneity, humor, and charm are amongs t the strongest assets of a 3 Tree. They are 
also invaluable in providing fresh insights a nd new opinions. As their upward motion energy 
suggests, 3 Trees are very active.  They like to explore and choose their own path. People born in 
the 3 Tree position like to win, but evolved 3 Trees al so have the capacity to feel joy when others 
succeed. This being the case, enlightened 3 Trees  are extremely pleased when everyone wins. 
For this reason, they can be very  effective leaders. 3 Trees make good performers and often act 
spontaneously, sometimes without c onsidering the ramifications of their actions. Therefore, they 
tend to learn through experience. 
4 Tree 
The 4 Tree's nature is governed by air. The trigram wind can denote anything from a slight 
breeze to a full-fledged hurricane. The 4 Tree is one  of the most emotional of the nine signs. 
Although they appear gentle a nd easygoing at times, they can also be stubborn, impulsive, 
capricious, and moody. Although they have a similar nature to th at of the 3 Tree, they are more 
practical, thoughtful, and reliable. They have great common sense and sensitivity to others, 
which can work for them and against them. Wh en this sensitivity is combined with good 
listening skills, 4 Trees can be gifted counselors. However, their trusting and sometimes gullible nature makes them too easily influenced by more  powerful individuals. Their sensitivity makes 
them deeply appreciative of the arts in all thei r forms. They are gifted with excellent verbal 
skills, and make charismatic orators, leaders, and political figures. The natural element of wind 
can cause them to change their mind-and their direction in life-frequently . On the other hand, the 
same wind works positively, allowing them to sp read their influence to others, as well. 
4 Trees take everyone at face value, which can caus e difficulties in relationships. Therefore, it is 
advisable that they seek the advice of a friend or  someone they trust before committing to a long-
term relationship. 4 Trees can provide very power ful and practical advice within their field of 
expertise. The archetype of the absent-minded pr ofessor fits well here. However, their responses 
to questions that are outside of  their preferred field of knowledge  may be less practical. If they 
are pushed into a field or vocation that is of litt le personal interest, they will be miserable; they 
chafe against oppressive situati ons. 4 Tree people have a great l ove for life, and focus upon those 
things that can provide the deepest personal mean ing. Therefore, they tend to be romantics and 
idealists. Because of their capacity for analytic al thought and devotion to their metier, their 
genius can be expressed in many different ways. 
5 5011 
This sign is at the center of this system of astrology, so if you are a 5 Soil you will always find 
yourself at the center of what is going on. At work you will frequently be in the hub of discussions or arguments, and will probably feel left out if this is not the case. In family life, you 
will let your opinions and needs be known to t hose around you. You have a great capacity to control situations and are likely to take the lead. People often look to you for leadership and 
guidance. Although this can be fulfilling and exhi larating at times, friends can lean on you a bit 
too much and sometimes take advantage. If you are caught off guard or not feeling well, this 
could be draining for you. At these times, you need  to protect yourself from being exploited. The 
5 Soil position symbolizes the beginning and end of  a cycle. Likewise, y ou could have a life of 
ups and downs, some of them extreme. However, you should not take this as  a negative, as 5 Soil 
people have great resilience and bounce back easily after times of trouble. It is not unusual for 5 
Soil individuals to make similar mistakes throug hout their lives, but their resilient nature helps 
them deal with challenges far more easily than a ny of the other eight characters. You tend to take 
criticism or advice as a threat, which can make you either defensive or even more determined. 
You are bold and determined, sometimes aggressive ly so, and can bring about enormous change 
through the reinvention or destruction of old syst ems or patterns. Because you are at the center of 
this astrological system, others will natura lly gravitate towards you, and you will enjoy the 
attention. As a result, you may find yourself in unusual circum stances-involved with someone 
much older or much younger or involved in a lo ve triangle, for instance. There may be further 
complications in your relationships due to divo rce, stepchildren, and so  on. Health-wise, you 
have a great capacity to bounce back from stress- related illness and general health problems. For 
this reason you must remember to exercise a nd challenge yourself. The 5 Soil person is a good 
manager and controller of vent ures, projects, and households. The 5 Soil can be found in all 
walks of life, from very humble surroundings to  the highest circles of wealth and power. The 
evolved 5 Soil knows that he or she can have a profound influence upon the well-being of others 
and will use his or her energy toward that end. 
6 Metal 
The most obvious trait of this si gn is natural leadership and author ity. This can be in politics, the 
military, fashion, or the fine arts. Many 6 Meta ls have broken new ground and paved the way for 
future generations. With the full force of heaven present in their trigram, they can be extremely 
moral, direct, and noble. The cons istent nature of the three lines can also make them rational, 
careful, and sometimes even rigid. They are active and sociable, but more reserved than the 7 
Metals. They tend to be perfectionists and are qu ietly self-critical. The worst mistake that anyone 
can make with a 6 Metal friend is to criticize hi m or her. Most 6 Metals place a lot of emphasis 
on family values. If this is your sign, you are a na tural leader in the family and the community, 
and will often give up your outside interests to return to the home if that is what the situation warrants. If you do not have a family of your ow n, you may well be at the center of the action in 
the workplace. You are a born leader in most si tuations. In relationships , you are the most loyal 
of all the nine signs. You are most comfortable in a relationship in which you can take the lead. 
Despite the fact that you are gove rned by the full force of yang en ergy, the opposite side of this 
nature can come through, as well, showing up as  strong intuition, logical, rational thinking, and a 
wise approach to family and relationship problem s. The 6 Metal Person is very good at providing 
solidarity and purpose to a group or an event. 6 Metals have a strong sense of ethics and 
propriety. Choosing a practical approach over idealis m, they can be strict and strong-willed when 
applying their authority. Many mechanics, machinists, engineers, and jewelers are 6 Metals. Evolved 6 Metals are socially oriented and work for the greater good of the team or family. They 
share their opinions on life by setting a strong example through their behavior, rather than 
verbalizing their ideas. They practice what th ey preach. They are good financial managers and excel at producing finished produc ts. Although most 6 Metals are main stream thinkers, with little 
interest or belief in methods that are not tried and true, they can also have very strong powers of 
intuition. In some cases, this intuition can become so pronounced that some would call it 
psychic. 
7 Metal The time of year associated with the 7 Metal is late autumn, when farmers traditionally celebrate 
the harvest with relaxation and enjoyment. Number 7 Metals are great pleasure-seekers who, 
more than any other of the 9 signs, enjoy spe nding money on fashion, entertainment, and eating 
out. With their capacity to listen and be receptive to  others, they make great hosts. If this is your 
sign, you are charismatic, optimistic, flamboyant , and graceful, and you probably dress and 
appear younger than you are. Li ke the 6 Metal, you have lead ership qualities, but these are 
displayed in the advice you give others or the direction you suggest in th e workplace. You have a 
capacity for fun and are endowed  with a good sense of humor. With your free and independent 
nature you are not keen on long-term commitments at work or in relationships. As the symbolic 
"youngest daughter" in the 9 Star  Ki system, you have the accu mulated experience and wisdom 
of the rest of the family to help you. Y our eloquence and sense of timing makes you an 
exceptionally good speaker; indeed, many 7 Metals are famous orators or politicians. 7 Metals 
often vacillate between their out going, fun-loving, and sociable side, and a deeper, reflective, 
more spiritual nature. The 7 Meta l personality reflects the sensual feel of the early evening hours 
and the setting sun. 7 Metals are often intere sted in fashion, clothi ng, jewelry, and beauty. 
Although they appear to be emoti onal and superficial on the surface , on the inside they are solid. 
The evolved 7 Metal is very organized and will have  a practical response to almost any situation. 
This trait provides balance to an otherwise ex citable and overly emotional nature. They are 
verbally gifted and can easily sway the opinions of others. Due to their natural sensuality and 
general attractiveness, 7 Metals are easily noticed  in and promoted quick ly through the ranks of 
an organization. Although they can be extremely practical and patient, they flourish best when 
receiving the attention and support of others. 
8 Soil 
As the symbolic "youngest son," the 8 Soil benefi ts from the combined experience of the older 
brothers and sisters. They often have good financial sense and accumulate wealth during their 
youth, either through their own hard work or through an inheritance. If an 8 Soil's investment or 
business fails before middle age, he or she is quite likely to succeed again. If this is your sign, your success in achieving material wealth te nds to be achieved more through your single-
mindedness than through any subtlety, charm, or creative talent. The most "yang" of the three 
soil types, you tend to move slowly and pers istently as you learn from your experiences. 
Although you have a strong, stable character with enormous rese rves of energy, you need to 
retreat into your "cave" from time to time, whic h makes you seem reserved and cool to others. Of 
all the nine signs, you are perhaps the hardest to get cl ose to; you generally c onceal your feelings 
and only display them when provoked. When you are challenged, you can dart out of your sequestered shelter and deliver a powerful argumen t. You also have a strong sense of what is 
right and just; indeed, many 8 Soils are involved in human rights. With your strength and 
forethought, you can bring about change and revoluti on in people's lives. Your main asset is your composed, solid nature that can ride out most difficulties in life. Your experience and your 
hidden strength can be of enormous help to family, friends, and colleagues. The 8 Soil is up for 
anything that fits in with his or her plans, and usually, these plans include lending a helpful hand 
to anyone and everyone. 8 Soils are kindhearted, fair-minded, and family-oriented. When they 
feel that justice has no t been served, they are quick to speak out and take remedial action. These 
individuals alternate between peri ods of reserved, deep thought a nd extroverted action. They are 
deep thinkers as well as boisterous revelers. The evolved 8 Soil will study important issues 
before taking action. They often have a very stra ightforward set of plans concerning their career 
and what they want to accomplish next, but they  are not afraid to become involved with new 
ideas and directions. They are courageous tr avelers and make personable road companions. 
Although they tend to move often, 8 Soils love fam ily. Even if their experiences keep them from 
settling down at an early age, the thought of family is always there. As they age, their love and 
respect for their elders deepens. 
9 Fire 
The 9 Fire person has all the qualities that the sun bestows-inspiration, enlightenment, charisma, 
and status. 9 Fires have an e normous capacity to see the obscu re and steer a path through 
troubled waters. In politics, part icularly in times of change a nd revolution, they can inspire a 
nation. Their natural active energy attracts them to  stagnant situations that require major change. 
Of all the nine stars, th is is the one that is mo st at home in the field of communication, especially 
when it concerns the emotions and personal expe riences. These traits, along with their warm, 
passionate nature, can also make them successful in theater and film. 9 Fires can be proud, vain, 
sophisticated, and critical. If th is is your sign, the sensitive na ture that underlies your strong, 
successful surface image can erupt stormily, but you are also the quickest to forgive and forget. 
Like your brother the middle son (1 Water), you do not like to have your space invaded; as a 
result, you have plenty of contacts, but few real  close friends. Your capacity to see clearly and 
understand the big picture does not help you deal w ith the minutiae of day- to-day living (such as 
repairing the washing machine or changing the oil in your car). However, appearances are 
important to you; in your clothes,  your cars, and the contents of  your home, you pay considerable 
attention to detail. You also dislike individuals w ho are sloppy or untidy or who display poor 
manners. The world would be a much duller place without the colorful, s ophisticated, inspiring 
number 9 Fire. You lift the spirit and inspire t hose around your with your attitude and skills. 9 
Fires are good at developing new ideas and initia ting fresh activities, but in order to reach a 
successful conclusion, their path must be well-d efined. Their temperament can change quickly, 
so it is sometimes difficult to know what their mood will be next. Outgoing and enthusiastic, these individuals are bri lliant on the surface, but th eir plans and opinions ar e not always carefully 
thought out. The evolved 9 Fire wi ll use his or her good fortune, charisma, and outgoing nature 
to develop a business or professi on that will balance his/her some what chaotic existence with the 
more substantial, material aspect s of life. When 9 Fires learn to  channel their flamboyant nature, 
they can obtain the social approval and support th ey crave. Many 9 Fires are very successful in 
public relations and sales positions , but often have difficulty settli ng down in a long-term job or 
marriage.
